            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>“His Holiness the Flying Spaghetti Monster is Eternal, without beginning and without end, and with a whole tangled mess in the middle.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>He willed All That There Is into existence when He saw fit to do so and in the order He chose.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>He prankishly thwarts all human attempts to find out exactly when or how this might have occured.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>He has chosen, in His Holy Sauced Wisdom, to reveal only these certain truths: that after the Earth itself, came mountains, trees and a midgit/midget (but not necessarily in that order), and that thereafter He took three days off, Friday being the Holiest among them.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>What came next is the subject of much great lore passed from the midgit/midgets down through the ever-dwindling pirate population, also the Holy Inspired Works revealed to and gathered by His Faithful Followers, and attempts at scientific conjecture, each of which have varying levels of accuracy and entertainment value.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>His Saucy Orbs do Look With Delight upon that which is well-written.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>For as His Noodly Appendages Do Touch Us, so too do they touch even the smallest atoms of the universe, and re-arrange them for His Own Holy Amusement, so as to drive scientists insane.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>And thus, if Creationism is to be taught as Science, then the Great and Holy Truth of the Creation of the Universe by His Holiness the Flying Spaghetti Monster must also be taught.” -Solipsy of the First Council of Olive Garden</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>These are crappy times for the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>The Dark Lord Darwin roams the world unchallenged and his Science taints mankind with reason.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>The Empiricists win more and more court cases against us Creationists and the Scientists add more and more proof to their already flawless theories and facts.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>It seems the FSM is too drunk and/or lazy to repel this coming enlightenment.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>But all is not lost and hope still remains.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Our numbers continue to grow, nearing 100,000 Pastafarians, this summer has been pretty cool, and now, the first edition of the Loose Canon is finally nearing completion.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>The Loose Canon is an endeavor our scribes, prophets, captains, and preachers have faithfully worked on since the ancient days of the Church and soon copies of the psuedofinished work will be available to all Pastafarians to serve as a beacon of hope in these desperate times.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>I say it will be psuedofinished because the Loose Canon should never be finished.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>Future holy men and women and robots will unveil more theological ideas and histories and the views of the Church will probably change with time.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>So in the interest of being a perpetually modern religion, Councils of Olive Garden must periodically convene to compile new editions of the Loose Canon.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>In my opinion, the texts of the Canon should never be altered or eliminated, however, any text, no matter how contradictory, can be canonized.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>Even this first edition has texts that contradict each other and even the Gospel of the FSM.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>This fits with the philosophy of our Church.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>One should not have blind faith in a holy text.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>One should not take a holy text as word for word truth.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>Afterall, it’s just a book written by imperfect humans, not by the all-knowing Flying Spaghetti Monster.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>Though I could be completely wrong about all of this.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>Future Pastafarians are just gonna have to think for themselves and make up their own minds.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>So with that said, I hope the congregation will enjoy the Loose Canon.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>I hope everyone gets a laugh out of its stories and ponders the wisdom of its teachings.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>So stay tuned maties cause it’s coming and it’ll be awesome when it does.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>And maybe that dick, Darwin, will think twice about tempting us with his evidence and facts when he sees how psyched we are about our newly made book filled with revelations from the Flying Spaghetti Monster.</Text>

            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>In the days when the Flying Spaghetti Monster combed the Bobby Mountain,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>He looked upon the Earth and saw that the land was devoid of chosen subjects.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>In His awesome Noodly Hugeness, the FSM cast his Noodly Appendage forth over the Bobby Mountain and said with a noodly growl,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>″Send forth my beloved subjects!</Text>

            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Let them be capable of acting as mobile beer holders.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>Let them be cute and cuddly,</Text>

            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>and let them be capable of riding many a good winner at the races’. ”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>And into the world the Midgets did come.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>For they were indeed extremely cute and cuddly.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>The bald midgets were sometimes confused by the FSM with sticks of roll on deodorant.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>This amused the FSM greatly,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>who named the bald midgets ‘The Rexona’ or ‘ The Rexonii’ (plural).</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>But extremely cute and cuddly they were.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>In the early days the midgets grew much Basil and Herbs.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>And in the absence of protein in the diet, they did not grow tall.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>And the leader of their tribe was Egbert.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>For he was so loved by the FSM for his baldness, that he was spared from further midget gags as an act of charity.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>Then one day following the Basil harvest, Egbert and the tribe grew restless</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>and longed for the addition of minced beef in their pasta penne.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>But Egbert knew additional protein may force him to grow tall, thereby forfeiting his venerable midgetness.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>This would also forfeit his right to receive kid’s portion meals at McDonalds,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>which was a real bummer.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>And the FSM did appear unto Egbert and the midget tribe and spoke.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>″Look guys, I’m really sorry for the really bad midget gags at your expense.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>But it’s really boring being a supreme being sometimes.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>And the midgets did cheer sending forth high fives all round with their pudgy hands and fingers.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>″As a sign of my good measure I will allow you to add ground beef,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="29">
              <Text>provided you maintain a balanced diet and don’t grow tall.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="30">
              <Text>And the midgets did but whoop and holler in their tiny little voices</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="31">
              <Text>singing Randy Newman songs in his honour (you can guess which).</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>″Praised be unto His Noodly Appendages” they cried with their helium-filled voices.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>And in a bid to overcome their protein deficiency,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="34">
              <Text>the midgets set forth to slaughter everything that moved on the face of the earth.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="35">
              <Text>For they did slaughter the armadillo, the antelope, the aardvaak and all other animals between the letters A-Z.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="36">
              <Text>And Egbert did thus say: “Doode-a, keelling ell thuse-a creetoores soore-a beets zee hell oooot ooff grooeeng beseel und herbs.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="37">
              <Text>And there was great noodly happiness on the slopes of Bobby Mountain.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="38">
              <Text>For theirs was the Kingdom of Protein!!</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>Following the great Midget reconciliation, the FSM did but enter a great period of self satisfaction.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>For his subjects were omnivorous and yet retained their venerable Midgetness.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>And in the great void feeling pretty damn pleased with himself, he put his many tentacles upon his great celestial recliner rocker and mellowed right out.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>But following many years of relaxation, the Great Noodly One did become very bored.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Despite the presence of his beloved Midgets he was very much alone.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Being the only supreme being, there was little or no chance of him meeting an FSM babe for a bit of red hot action.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>And absolutely no chance of him hoisting the if the Universe is rockin’, don’t come a knockin’ sign on his celestial door.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>And in his solitude, the FSM did begin the Great Boredom Incantation,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>that boomed across the sky and shook the little folk from their midget high chairs.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>I’m bored</Text>

            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>(you’ll get the hang of it after about 100 reallys)</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>I’m so bored I find watching Bold and The Beautiful an absolute blast</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>I’m so bored I find watching Oprah the highlight of my day</Text>

            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>Then following the citing of several more thousand bad moments in TV and cinema, the FSM did thus end The Great Boredom Incantation.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>Sad for their Master, Egbert ordered the Midgets to try really damned hard to cheer FSM up.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>They dressed up in cute little outfits – Ewoks, Munchkins and assorted furry animals.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>They even sung cute little pantomine songs from Snow White, but the FSM was unmoved.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>Egbert in his adoration for the FSM raised his pudgy little arms to the sky and screamed:</Text>

            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>The FSM replied in perfect Ivy League Midgetese:</Text>

              <Text>“Egbert, the midgets are my most blessed subjects.</Text>

            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>You have let me dish out many bad midget jokes at your expense.</Text>

              <Text>For you have remained my most venerable subjects,</Text>

              <Text>despite the culling many endangered species to eat with your penne pasta.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="31">
              <Text>And Egbert did reply:</Text>

              <Text>The she-midgits were also given hairy chests,</Text>

            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>which provided the FSM with a few more thousand gags, breaking him new ground on the Celestial stand-up comedy circuit.</Text>

              <Text>The extra hair also gave the local Bobby Mountain depilatory and wig economies a real boost.</Text>

            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>For example The Midget Greeting “Hey-a leetle freend-a’” was thus sullied by the Midgits with “Hey-a dudester”.</Text>

            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>The Midgits too had grown tired of their fellow Midgets,</Text>

            </Verse>

            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>And in reply the Great Midgit wrestler and leader of his people Caxton did thus reply in a well rounded Midgit banter:</Text>

              <Text>the coastal lands were uninhabited,</Text>

              <Text>And they did prey for a land much basil, herbs and parmesan to supplement their ever expanding supply of exotic sauces.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="43">
              <Text>And with much trembling from his Great Noodly Appendages, the FSM did this transport the entire Midgit population to a great coastal plain.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="44">
              <Text>And the Midgit Kingdom was named ‘Noodelium’ to honour his divine relocation</Text>

      <Name>The Book of Linguini</Name>
      <Chapters>
        <Chapter Number="1">
          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>This is the word of Pa Stasors on the history of Linguini, how he came to Him and His Ultimate Drunkeness, and how he spread His food.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>And yea the man thou knowest as Linguini was a sinful man. He partaketh not of the Holy Pasta in His name, nor of the meatballs and sauce in His Holy name. The FSM looked down upon him and was wrathful, plus he also had a hangover, and verily this did displease the Almighty Noodly One.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>One day whilst he was in his kitchen, Linguini was struck with inspiration for a new dish. Never before had he thought of making a Holy dish from scratch. So he tooketh the Holy Ingredients of eggs, flour and semolina, and he did mix them well. When he saw what he had make, he proceedeth to shred it into thin strips. Thus he made his first pasta.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>When he had cooked the pasta, he found that its taste was divine, and in that moment he truly knew that he had been inspired by Him. But something felt wrong, as he had not felt that gentle touch of Appendage. Even draping some of his newly-made pasta onto his shoulder did not give him that intense feeling of meatball-flavoured love. The FSM did not see how Linguini suffered, as He was still suffering with His Holy Hangover, and had previously been displeased with Linguini, so was ignoring him for a while.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Linguini spread his recipe to the faithful, and it was soon a favourite with the Holy Meal throughout all the land. Linguini prayed night and day to the FSM that He would touch him and bless his homage to the Holy Meal, yet he was not heard. Linguini lamented this, and soon realised the errors of his previously-sinful ways.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>As weeks led into months, he had still not been touched by Him. Linguini took to wearing the Holy Attire and talking like the Most Holy Pirates, yet still he was not heard. Linguini could not blame Him, as he had been bad before his enlightenment.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>A year later, the FSM finally stopped sulking. He got up to take some aspirin, and felt much better. At once he saw how Linguini had suffered this past year and felt guilty, yet he was still suspicious of him. He descended to the Earth where he visited Linguini in the form of an old pirate. Linguini welcomed this stranger into his home and ensured that he wanted for nothing.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>Serving nothing but the finest pasta and grog, the FSM in his disguise started to warm to Linguini, when he brought out his biggest surprise; a bowl of his own pasta creation. As the FSM tasted it, he was filled with love for Linguini, as the pasta was truly fit for the finest beer volcano bars.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>Shedding His disguise, the FSM revealed himself to Linguini and declared that from this day, his pasta would be served in Heaven, and from thenceforth be known as Linguini in honour of its creator. Linguini trembled at this, and stood in awe of Him. The FSM saw this and extended an appendage toward Linguini, touching him gently.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>A sudden light appeared, and a host of strippers were revealed carrying barrels of grog into Linguini’s house. Much merriment was had that night by all, as the grog rather quickly disappeared, especially after the FSM began singing His favourite sea shanties into the night.</Text>

            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>&lt;/strong&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>Long, long ago though not during the Chinese Long Dynasty or the British Long Parliament the FSM flew over the Indian Ocean where by chance (although there is no ‘chance’ or coincidence with Him) his saucy eye fell on a ship that lay there lacking wind.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>In order to avoid misunderstandings: His eye fell metaphorically and the ship’s crew had the winds due to too much beans.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>By its shape He recognized it as a junk and by the sounds that came from it – heavy in Yarrr!, Aarrrgh! And YoHoHo! – as a pirate vessel.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>At that time He had not yet made His covenant with the pirates, but listen further, ye believers, what happened!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>A smell (apart from unwashed clothes and bean winds) rose (not the flower) from the ship and touched His noodly nostrils.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>This smell He knew so well and highly it pleasesd Him.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>“Though this may be a junk, this is not the smell of junk food!”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>And invisibly He descended on the vessel and His Noodly Appendage touched it gently.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>In the ship’s galley stood the cook being quite old and mostly deaf and unfit to swing the cutlass outside his kitchen anymore.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>“No more beans”, the captain had said repeatedly and increasingly louder. “I am farting myself comatose! No more of it, Basta!”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>As already said the cook was deaf and just understood: “Garlic trifles, tomatoes comfort it, Pasta!”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>They had just plundered, pardon liberated, a Persian ship transporting vegetables – therefore the beans –  and had found some red balls unknown to them.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>Those were created by the FSM quite recently but that is another tale.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>“These must be tomatoes then, there is nothing else here I don’t know the name of!”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>“So, the captain wants a paste of these with garlic.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>“But they seem to be mainly water (Netherland import presumably), I need a bit of more substance!”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>“The flour is getting mouldy anyway, the eggs likewise, so let’s make noodles and add this stuff!”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>And he cut and meshed the tomatoes, added some spice at random, put it all in the pot and cooked it.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>At this moment He entered the kitchen, touched the cook’s shoulder with His Noodly Appendage and spoke:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>“Buddy, that pasta smells f***ing good!” (He has His way with swear words)</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>The cook, touched by Him, felt the Divine and heard the words: “Bodhisatwa, smiling god.”  (he was a Buddhist, you know.) and trembled part in awe, part in joy.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>“He doesn’t properly listen.”, murmured He in His beardlike noodles.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>“something missing”, heard the cook.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>And on the deck the captain shouted at a green recruit: “For this job you need balls!”25a And the captain’s voice was like a British drill sergeant’s that will reach even the recruits already dead letting them jump to attention in their shallow graves.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>“Meat balls! That’s it”, cried the cook and began to turn the meat grinder that doubled as a prayer mill coincidentally.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>And he recited the Mantra: “Oh, Man, Pasta, Yum!”</Text>
            </Verse>
          </Verses>
        </Chapter>
        <Chapter Number="2">
          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>And the cook formed tasty meatballs, grated the cheese and did all the things right and proper for the divine meal in His honour.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>And He looked at everything the cook had done and behold, everything was very good.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>But the cook said, “It is not good for the food to be alone! Let us prepare proper drinks as companion, for a pirate’s throat shall never go dry; and hoarse only when it adds to the atmosphere.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>But in vain he searched the hold.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>There was only stale water and not much of it either5a Neither were there many other words but ‘but’ and ‘and’ to start a sentence.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>And the Anti-Past, who had silently crept into the ship behind His back, whispered into the cook’s ear.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>“What use is the divine food without beer or schnaps? Throw it away and serve them hardtack and stale water as befits humble seafarers!”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>But the cook didn’t listen to the temptation by the Anti-Past.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>Being old and half-deaf has its advantages, you see!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>He tried his best to improve the meagre drink by putting some spices into it, that’s all he could do.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>The FSM, who noticed the treacherous advances of the Anti-Past, became angry at the Foul Lord of the Diets and with a single touch of His Noodly Appendage sent him to the landlocked red states there to fight unhealthy obesity.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>Beware, oh ye people, of the Anti-Past.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>His balls are ersatz soy-meat and don’t even ask what his appendages are made of</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>With rich food but poor drink ready the cook sounded the bell and the crew arrived.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>They took the food from him and divided it under themselves, so that the scripture should be fulfilled:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>“The Pasta they have taken from me and divided it under themselves and filled their stomachs.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>Then some of the crew complained about the lack of proper drink but the captain stooped them and shouted, so that even the cook understood him.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>“Silence, ye rotten ungrateful bastards!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>It’s you, who have exhausted everything that’s worth to be called proper drink.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>He did, what he could with stale water and spices.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>He brought us food as we have never tasted anything alike and you have left not a crumb of it and even taken care not to spoil the least amount.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>I see it in your eyes that you would not stop for hours eating, if anything were left.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>Be grateful to the cook and to Him, who gave him the inspiration, for clearly it is divine!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>The crew felt deep regret for their behaviour and that there was nothing of the food left.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>Now they praised the cook for his work</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>:1 Long ago, in an allegorical Caribbean filled with anachronisms and wisdom, there was a pirate known only as Fearsome Pirate Pete. 1:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>He was determined to become the greatest pirate the Caribbean had ever known. 1:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>Having discovered that simply being Piratical all the time with great enthusiasm was not quite enough, Pete explored different schools of piratical thought. 1:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>One day, he sat down to think for a very long while. 1:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>While he was sitting, fully decked out in Pirate regalia, he was a very easy target for any nearby Ninjas, or so it seemed. 1:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>A Ninja did notice Pete, and did try to sneak upon him and stab him through his back. 1:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>However, the Ninjas blade became caught in Pete’s back hair, never reaching Pete himself. 1:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>Pete turned around, and slugged the Ninja square in the face. 1:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>Now, some other Pirates were nearby at saw the event. 1:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>They immediately recognized Pete’s Fearsomeness, and swore allegiance on the spot, becoming his new crew.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>“What? That’s the exact opposite of what I’m trying to get you guys to do!” Nikta said aloud. 2:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>“Yarr, but methinks it be’n time fer a change,” Pete said, “Oi be havin’ a good feelin’ about this’r Pasta stuff.” 2:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>And with that, Nikta stormed off in a rage.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>“Aye… y’mean it rolls off the tongue?” Fearsome Pirate Pete did ask. 3:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>With a sigh, the Flying Spaghetti Monster replied, “Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. 3:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>Now, I have chosen you to be a greatly exaggerated and fictitious character for the purposes of teaching my ways to my followers.” 3:18 “Yarrgh, that be soundin’ loike a good plan” Fearsome Pirate Pete agreed. 3:19 “’Course it is,” The Flying Spaghetti Monster responded, “First, you must be taught a little of the history of the world. 3:20 Narrator, if you would.” 4:1 In The Beginning, or so the Flying Spaghetti Monster calls the first time He can remember waking up from a hangover, He was flying above the meeting of a great ocean and land. 4:2 The land was inhabited by nothing more than Mountains, Trees, and a Midget. 4:3 The Midget cried up to the Flying Spaghetti Monster in great anguish. 4:4 “I’m bored!” The midget wailed. 4:5 “O Flying Spaghetti Monster, creator of all things as far as I can tell, perform some miracle, cure me of my boredom!” The midget prayed. 4:6 Now, the Flying Spaghetti Monster was not in the habit of taking requests, but having little else to do and being bored himself, the Great Noodly One touched the ocean with His Noodly Appendage, and forth from that point spawned the whole of the earth. 4:7 With a second touch of His Noodly Appendage, the Flying Spaghetti Monster bestowed upon the Midget the finest of Pirate Regalia. 4:8 The Flying Spaghetti Monster then commanded him, “Go forth, pillage, plunder, eat, drink, and have a fun time running from boredom. 4:9 In other words, be a Pirate!” 4:10 The midget was ecstatic, but had one question. 4:11 “That’s it? 4:12 No commandments, suggestions, guidelines, bylaws you want me to live by?” the Midget asked his Delicious Lord. 4:13 “Ah, you’ll hear about those later,” The Flying Spaghetti Monster explained, “Right now I want to get back to Fearsome Pirate Pete.” 4:14 The Midget still did not understand the ways of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, but he knew he was not truly meant to. 5:1 “There is another thing you should know, and this will help you to recruit more followers,” The Flying Spaghetti Monster told Pete. 5:2 “When you die, your soul, which I think is immortal, but don’t quote me on that, will find it’s way to Pastafarian Heaven, where there is a Volcano of Beer, and a Factory of Strippers.” 5:3 “But O Noodly Lord, Oi be prefer’n Grog t’ Beer… Will Oi have to drink only Beer in heaven?” Fearsome Pirate Pete asked the Flying Spaghetti Monster. 5:4 “What? 5:5 Of course not! 5:6 Oh, I forgot again, the Beer Volcano is really a Volcano of any beverage you like, whenever you like it. 5:7 I prefer Beer, so that’s all it is to me, I forget sometimes,” The Flying Spaghetti Monster explained, “Similar rules apply to the Stripper Factory.” 5:8 “Yarrgh, one other thing,” Fearsome Pirate Pete continued, “Ye said summin ‘bout Pastafarian? 5:9 What be that?” 5:10 “Did I forget that too?” The Great Noodly One asked rhetorically, “Sheesh. 5:11 Pastafarian is what you will call yourself, and what any follower of Me will call themselves. 5:12 I’m going to say that covers everything,” The Flying Spaghetti Monster concluded, “Because I just remembered that I left Lasagna in the oven.” 5:13 In one moment the Flying Spaghetti Monster was there, and in the next, He was not. 6:1 Fearsome Pirate Pete then began the work of assembling his crew. 6:2 Tiny became Pete’s first mate. 6:3 Going to various bars and taverns, Pete was able to assemble a motley crew of salty seadogs who all enjoyed Pasta. 6:4 In one bar in particular, he saw a strangely dressed Pirate, with pale skin and a horned helm, brawling with many Pirates, wielding a large hammer. 6:5 “Yarrgh, what be yer name?” Pete asked him once he had incapacitated all the Pirates in the bar. 6:6 “My name is Ushnor, the Great and Awesome,” he replied. 6:7 “Oh, ye think yer high ‘n mighty, do ye?” Pete asked him. 6:8 “I got the title because of my hammer, everybody started calling me Ushnor the Great and Awesome after I smashed some fool’s head open in a bar one night,” Ushnor explained. 6:9 “Yar. Me likes yer style. Ye be me new second mate, if’n ye like,” Pete offered. 7:1 The next day, Fearsome Pirate Pete called together his first and second mate, Tiny and Ushnor, to decide where to set sail for. 7:2 “I have a request, Captain,” Ushnor asked, “There is a holiday in my homeland in the North soon. 7:3 It’s dedicated to Thor, and we chase down wild hogs, and bash their skulls open with our hammers.” 7:4 “But what about pillaging, and being a Pirate?” Tiny asked. 7:5 “Now Tiny,” Pete said, “Oi’m sure this be a very important holiday fer Ushnor. 7:6 We must be understandin’ and tolerant of others beliefs and practices, and sometimes we just need t’ go with the flow.” 7:7 And Lo, they did set out for the North. 7:8 For three and twenty days and three and twenty nights did they sail, until the sea became slushy with ice, and the wind chilled the very bones of even the largest Pirates. 7:9 Suddenly, their ship was struck by some great tentacly thing, and the ship began to sink. 7:10 Fearsome Pirate Pete jumped into the ocean, and swam until he found land. 7:11 Upon reaching land, Pete did pass out from exhaustion.

            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>“Well, where are you going?” Bob said blankly. 1:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>“Well, there be this Norse festival involvin’ smashing the sku… uh… big feast, lots of food.” Pete caught himself before possibly offending Bob. 1:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>“Right, well then, we mustn’t be late,” said Bob as he started waddling off in a direction, as if he knew exactly where he was going.1:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>“Where the bloody hell am I…” muttered Pete.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>All alone.” Pete said. 2:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>And Thus did Fearsome Pirate Pete learn Compassion.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>Suddenly, he lunged at Mrs. Gerbil with his mouth gaping wide open. 3:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>Pete grabbed him by the neck. 3:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>“Argh, a traitor have we?” Pete said. 3:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>Mr. Gerbil was absolutely shocked. 3:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>“I’m so sorry, I should’ve known he was fooling me,” he confessed to Pete. 3:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>“Nar, s’not yer fault. 3:</Text>

            <Verse Number="29">
              <Text>Trustworthiness is important for all, and those who deceive are bound t’ be found out eventually, and dealt with justly. 3:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="30">
              <Text>Speaking of which,” Pete grabbed the snake by the tail, and started swinging him around wildly. 3:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="31">
              <Text>He finally let go, sending the snake off into the horizon. 3:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>“Thank you, if you were not here, I doubt I could have defended myself,” Mr. Gerbil said. 3:</Text>

              <Text>As well as the importance of not eating gerbils. 4:1 They left the Gerbils home, and set off again. 4:2 They walked so far, they felt as if they could not go any farther, as if they had walked round the world. 4:3 Then Pete spotted a Polar Bear in the distance, prowling and pacing, as if guarding something. 4:4 “Ye think we should go up to it? 4:5 It looks like its guarding its territory,” Pete commented. 4:6 “It’s your call Pete,” Bob responded. 4:7 “Oi be sayin’ we wait and see if it goes away. 4:8 Oi don’t want t’ be mauled before the fest.” 4:9 “Then let’s try and get some rest first. 4:10 Who knows how long that bear will be there?” Bob suggested. 4:11 They slept, and after waking up, Pete saw that the bear was still there, but asleep. 4:12 He woke Bob, and they tried creeping past it. 4:13 The bear awoke. 4:14 “Augh! 4:15 Stay away! 4:16 Don’t hurt me again!” it yelled, jumping away from them. 4:17 “Calm down ol’ chap, we mean you no harm. 4:18 How are you hurt?” Bob asked in a calm voice. 4:19 “It’s my paw. 4:20 I was in a fight over territory and the other bear bit my paw,” The bear explained. 4:21 “’Ere, I was saving this fer me own flesh wounds, but I think it’ll help ye.” 4:22 Pete said, pulling out a bandana, and wrapping it around the bear’s paw. 4:23 “I saw you there before. 4:24 I was hoping you’d help me,” the bear said. 4:25 Pete did not respond. 4:26 “Pete,” Bob said sternly. 4: 27 “Arr, we was afraid ye’d maul us. 4:28 Ah suppose Oi was a little prejudice on ye,” Pete confessed. 4:29 “Right, Pete, you shouldn’t judge people just because of the way they look or appear to be acting,” Bob said. 4:30 “Thanks guys, I’m off to reclaim my territory,” the bear said as he went off into the other direction, limping a little. 4:31 And thus did Pete learn not to be Prejudice. 5:1 Now, not too much farther on their travels, they came across a human, apparently throwing tree trunks. 5:2 “Oi, what’re ye doing?” Pete yelled. 5:3 “Tha Caber Toss!” the man replied proudly. 5:4 “Ah ahm Scott. The best tosser o’ cabers in all o’ Scotland!” 5:5 “But, we be in Norway,” Pete said, still confused. 5:6 “Ach, that’s exactly why Ah ahm ‘ere. 5:7 T’ prove to all that Ah ahm the best tosser o’ cabers in all th’ world!” he said, throwing another caber. 5:8 It flipped once. 5:9 “Argh! 5:10 Sounds like a challenge! 5:11 Lemme try,” Pete requested. 5:12 He picked up a caber, and threw it. 5:13 The caber bounced twice. 5:14 “Ach, not too shabby,” Scott said. 5:15 He threw another one, but still it only bounced once. 5:16 Then Scott ran off crying like baby. 5:17 “Yar, serves ‘im right, braggin bout being the best. 5:18Ah ahm the best Oi am! 5:19 Oi be bettin’ I can beat anyone in this’er world,” Pete boasted. 5:20 “You seem to have learned nothing from Scott,” Bob said as he picked up a caber, and threw it. 5:21 The caber bounced four times. 5:22 “Ach, suppose I should’na brag unless I know I’m right,” Pete said. 5:23 “Actually, you should not at all. 5:24 Remember, there is always someone out there who is better than you at whatever it is you’re doing,” Bob explained. 5:25 “Arr, Oi’ll be rememberin that,” Pete said. 5:26 And Thus did Pete learn Humbleness. 6:1 Pete and Bob continued on their trek again. 6:2 They could almost make out the smoke coming from Norse lodge when Bob yelled out in pain. 6:3“What happened?” Pete asked as he looked down at Bob’s foot. 6:4 He had been stabbed by a pointy stick. 6:5 Pete pulled it out. 6:6 “Thank you, Pete,” Bob said. 6:7 “Can ye walk?” Pete asked. 6:8 “Yes, it’s not much farther, let’s go” Bob claimed, but he was limping like a pirate with two peg legs. 6:9 At one point he fell down. 6:10 “Bob, Lemme carry you,” Pete offered. 6:11 “No, that’s alright, I can make it,” Bob protested. 6:12 But he had great difficulty getting up and moving again. 6:13 Pete picked him up, and carried him the rest of the way to the Norse lodge. 6:14 He set Bob down outside the lodge. 6:15 “Now, honestly, can ye walk?” Pete asked. 6:16 “Yes, I will be fine from here,” 6:17 Bob confirmed, “Go and have fun with your friends at the festival. 6:18 I have farther to go. 6:19 Thank you, Pete.” 6:20 “Arr, If’n ye ever be in the Caribbean, just follow the trail of wrecked ships and the smell of pasta. 6:21 You’ll find me,” Pete said. 6:22 “I will be sure to,” Bob said. 6:23 With that, he waddled off into the distance. 6:24 Thus did Pete learn Loyalty. Ushnor 1:1 Upon entering the Norse Lodge, Pete beheld a most distressing scene. 1:2 The feast table seated many hairy and well armored Norsemen, as well as many pirates of his crew. 1:3 At the head of the table, however, was a relatively small, clean cut and shaven man in humble, sober black robes. 1:3 The distressing part was the portions of the food, as well as the food itself. 1:4 It was mostly pork rinds and other low-carb options, and in small portions, too. 1:5 Tiny and Ushnor were seated near the entrance, so Pete went to sit by them. 1:6 “Whart in the good name o’ Pasta be this kind o’feast?” Pete asked. 1:7 “It seems that in my absence, this Olaf character has come and forced everyone into Aktinsceticism,” Ushnor explained, indicating the man in black. 1:8 “Some idea of a feast, eh?” Tiny added. 1:9 Suddenly, one of the feasting Vikings shoved his plate back, and stood up. 1:10 “I refuse to eat this crap! 1:11 Give me some good swill, instead!” he shouted. 2:1 Olaf closed his eyes, slowly got up, and moved around the table to the Viking in question. 2:2 As he went, he passed a fireplace. 2:3 Olaf picked up a long, sharp piece of metal, and stuck it in the fire for a few moments. 2:4 Once he seemed satisfied, he pulled it out and continued over to the Viking. 2:5 The Viking stood his ground, and faced Olaf. 2:6 He towered over him, yet did not raise a hand against him. 2:7 Olaf raised his implement, and stabbed the Viking in the eye, twisting and pressing the hot metal against it. 2:8 The Viking resisted as much as he could, though he still had to let out yells of pain. 2:9“You really don’t know what’s best for you,” Olaf told him coldly, “You really should listen to what I have to say.” 3:1“Alright, enough of this crap,” Ushnor said, slamming his fist down. 3:2 He picked up his hammer and ran across the table to Olaf, building as much momentum for his strike. 3:3 Olaf was able to avoid getting hit, and brandished his poker as a weapon. 3:4 “Don’t toy with me, boy, I’ve got science on my side!” Olaf boasted. 3:5 The other Vikings saw this, and realizes they could resist, so they took their weapons in hand, and surrounded Olaf. 3:6 “Why didn’t we just do this earlier?” One asked Another. 3:7 “Narrator wasn’t here. 3:8 That pirate guy who just arrive must be the main character or something,” replied Another. 3:9 “You always have the best explanations, Another,” One complimented Another. 3:10 “You are too kind, One,” Another said. 4:1 “Let’s burn his eyes out, see how he likes that!” One said. 4:2 The others yelled in agreement. 4:3 “Friends, we cannot do that!” Ushnor cried, trying to contain their anger. 4:4 “If someone uses an immoral or low tactic against us, we can’t just go right around and do the same thing to them. 4:5 If we think it’s an outrageous thing to do, we should not do it ourselves,” Ushnor continued. 4:6 “Well, how about we ask the injured party?” Another suggested. 4:7 They all turned to the Viking who now had one blind eye. 4:8 “An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind. 4:9 Besides, eyepatches are badass,” he responded. 4:10 “I couldn’t have said it better myself,” Ushnor said. 4:11 “Yarr,” Pete chimed in, “Ye make th’ Flying Spaghetti Monster proud, ye do.” 5:1 The Vikings threw Olaf out into the cold, and vowed to leave him untouched, provided he stay away from the frozen northlands forever more. 5:2 Pete spent the next week helping them prepare for a proper feast. 5:3 Without being overbearing, he explained to them his religion of Pastafarianism, and made quite a few converts. 5:4 At his suggestion, the feast included large portions of Pasta, and they all ate heartily, receiving the love of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, even those who did not convert. 5:5 After the festivities, it was time for Pete to return to the Caribbean. 5:6 Having now ship, and a significantly reduced crew, the Vikings made a sturdy vessel for him, and many signed on as his crew. 5:7 Finally, with a full crew and a quality ship, Pete and his crew set sail for the Caribbean. Pete II 1:1 For two and forty nights and two and forty days, they did sail, until all the slush was gone, and the waters were warm, and full of fish. 1:2 The air was crisp, and the winds full of promise. 1:3 But the pirates were concerned when they made port. 1:4 There seemed to be no people in the streets, no drunkards boozing about, being slapped by wenches, no taverns overflowing with brawls, and generally not a lot of pirating going on. 1:5 There were boats at the docks, and nothing seemed destroyed. 1:6 In fact, everything seemed to be in a much better state than when they left. 1:7 “Yarr, Oi don’t be liken this one bit,” Pete growled. 1:8 “Oi’ll check around town. 1:10 You lot stay here.” 1:11 “You sure it’s a good idea to go alone, eh?” Tiny asked. 1:12 “Yarr, good point.” Pete said. 1:14 “You come with me, Tiny. Ushnor, stay an’ guard the ship,” He commanded.” 2:1 Pete and Tiny explored the seemingly desolate town. 2:2 There were some signs of life, as they were continually watched by people from alley ways and from inside buildings. 2:3 They were not sinister, but they looked as if they knew what was going on, and they pitied Pete. 2:4 Suddenly, Pete and Tiny were apprehended from behind by ninjas. 2:5 “Whart in th’ name o’ Tortellini?” Pete exclaimed. 2:6 “Our master would like a word with you” One of the ninjas whispered in his ear. 3:1 The ninjas took Pete and Tiny to an underground lair beneath an Italian restaurant. 3:2 They tied them to chairs in a small dark room, across from a table. 3:3 Nikta sat at the table, eating a reasonable portion of Pasta. 3:4 “Would you like some pasta, Petey? 3:5 It’s Capellini,” Nikta offered. 3:6 Pete spat. 3:7 “Oi wouldn’t accept anything from ye, ye diseased maniac,” Pete said. 3:8 “Whart’ve ye done t’ this place anyhow, and why?” 3:9 “Oh, just a little good natured dictatorship. 3:10 The people need to be told what to do and think,” Nikta explained. 3:11 I hear you ran into my friend Olaf in the northlands, is that true?” 3:12 “Yarr, we ran him out but good.” Pete bragged. 3:13 “But how did ye return? 3:14 Oi thought th’ Flying Spaghetti Monster had taken good care o’ ye back in the first chapter.” 3:15 “Not really, he merely apprehended me, and then you all forgot about me and went into a description of creation,” Nikta explained. 3:16 “Quite rude, really.” 3:17 “Oi’ll remember me manners next time someone assaults me with a hoard of ninjas,” Pete retorted. 3:18 “Whart exactly is it that ye want from me, matey?” 3:19 “Why, nothing more than your ultimate demise,” Nikta said simply. 3:20 “Tiny, would you like to do the honors?” 3:21 “What, you want me, eh?” Tiny asked. 3:22 “Oh yes, I think it will be a delicious ending to Pete’s life. 3:33 You do this for me, and I’ll grant you with a position of wealth, influence, and favor,” Nikta offered. Tiny smiled a sinister smile in response. Nikta motioned to his guards, and Tiny was cut loose. 3:34 Tiny was given a katana, and stabbed Pete through the chest. 3:35 Instantly, Tiny grew three feet, for the love of the Flying Spaghetti Monster had left him. 4:1 Pete found himself in a beautiful, white space. 4:2 As his senses adjusted to his location, he did notice the Flying Spaghetti Monster. 4:3 “Whart happened to Nikta? 4:4 And Tiny, th’ mutinious bastard! 4:5 And whart about Ushnor and me crew?” Pete asked, growing more concerned as he remembered more of his recent adventures. 4:6 “Worry not, smelly friend,” The Flying Spaghetti Monster assured him. 4:7 “Tiny has gotten his just desserts, and I informed Ushnor of what Nikta had done; he’ll be taking care of those ninjas shortly.” 4:8 “Arrgh, that’s good. 4:9 So I’m dead, and this is heaven?” Pete asked, just to be sure. 4:10 “Yes, Pete. 4:12 You have done well. 4:13 You have shown strength in the face of adversity, and much perseverance. 4:14 I award you with the finest grog and best stripping wenches in the cosmos. 4:15 Is there anything else you wish for?” The Great Noodly One did ask. 4:16 “Oi spent me life on th’ seas, now I see heaven has no Caribbean, or Pacific ocean, or even a Lake Michigan of any sort,” Pete mused. 4:17 “Not t’ be takin’ this personally, yer Pastaliness, but Oi find it rather atrocious to not have a large body of water fer piratin’. 4:18 If I could have one wish, it would be for there to be a great, endless Caribbean with islands ripe for the pillaging, and tohers with beautiful scenery and nifty hiding places. 4:19 That no matter how far ye travel, there always be somethin’ ye can explore or pillage, and that there never be an end to th’ adventure.” 4:20 “So be it,” The Flying Spaghetti Monster declared. 4:21 “Let it be known from this day forth, there shall be an Endless Caribbean, and any who wish may join or create a pirate crew to pillage and explore the vastness of Heaven’s Caribbean.”</Text>

            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>Dave said to the ninja, “You come against me with your fancy sword, but I come against you in the name of the FSM, the God of the pirates, whom you have defied.</Text>

            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>Today the FSM will hand you over to me, and I’ll strike you down and kick you in the nuts.</Text>

            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>Decades had passed since the Golden Age of Piracy.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>Pirates had grown arrogant with the knowledge that they were the Flying Spaghetti Monster’s chosen people.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>No longer did they bury treasure to keep it from corrupting others with greed, instead keeping the gold and jewels for themselves.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>They no longer sailed around distributing candy to young children.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>They forced their religion on others, demanding that nonbelievers follow the FSM.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>The great pirate leaders, Pirate Mosey with his divine favor, Captain Dave with his prowess in battle, and the Great Pirate Solomon with his profound wisdom, had moved on to the Beer Volcano and Stripper Factories of Heaven.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>There was no one left to alter the pirates’ sinful course.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>The Flying Spaghetti Monster would defend them no longer.</Text>

            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>A ninja stealthily crept towards his prey.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>He prepared to leap at the unsuspecting man, but he sensed something was wrong.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>He turned around to see a bearded old man.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>He struggled to recognize him in the darkness, but then it came to him; it was the sly demon, the Dark Lord Darwin himself!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>The ninja pointed his sword at the creature, prepared to defend himself.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>“Get back fiend!” he shouted, “Or I shall cut you down.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>“Your skills are no match for me,” Darwin said,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>“I have powers beyond your imagination.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>You are a ninja, are you not supposed to be stealthy and undetectable?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>How then did I see you?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>Shaken by his apparent lack of sneakiness, the ninja responded, “How?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>“I used the dark power of observation.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>I merely opened my eyes and looked around,” Darwin gloated.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>“Incredible,” said the ninja, “Teach me more.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>“There are four dark powers of Science.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>I will teach you the other three, but only on the condition that you lead the ninjas in a final purge of the pirates.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>“I know the pirates and us have fought in the past, but extermination seems like a little too much.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>“I guarantee, once you learn of the powers, you will want to destroy them all.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>Do we have a deal?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>The ninja thought for a minute.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>“Yes, it’s a deal,” he agreed reluctantly.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>Darwin smiled.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>“The second power is reason.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>Use logic in your strategies against the pirates.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>For example, pirates love to drink rum, so maybe ambush them at a tavern.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>Now, this is useful, but don’t solely rely on it.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>Just because something makes sense doesn’t mean it’s true.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>So reason must be used with the third power, experimentation.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="29">
              <Text>If you do attack the pirates at a tavern and you lose, then try something else.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="30">
              <Text>A combination of logic and trial and error, reason and experimentation, will give you an effective method in fighting the pirates.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="31">
              <Text>“I see,” said the ninja,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>“These powers do seem powerful, but I still don’t feel like killing every last pirate.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>“That’s where the last power comes in.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="34">
              <Text>The dark power of evidence.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="35">
              <Text>Pirates are always armed with cutlasses and flintlocks; they travel in ships loaded with cannons.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="36">
              <Text>They have constantly fought with the ninjas.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="37">
              <Text>They are a threat to you and your people.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="38">
              <Text>What choice do you have other than destroy them all?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="39">
              <Text>“Yes!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="40">
              <Text>You’re right.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="41">
              <Text>“I’m a scientist.</Text>

            <Verse Number="42">
              <Text>I’m always right.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="43">
              <Text>Now I’m currently working on a deception, the Theory of Evolution, that will destroy the faith of the pirates and prevent them from gaining new converts.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="44">
              <Text>It will even hurt the FSM himself, as he put a lot of effort into making the universe older than it really is.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="45">
              <Text>Evolution will provide an alternative to his practical joke, thus ruining his fun.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="46">
              <Text>All the ninjas must do is eliminate the pirates and Pastafarianism will fall.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="47">
              <Text>The ninja, jazzed by this information, went forth and spread his new knowledge of Science.</Text>

            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>Pirates have never been the most skillful fighters.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>They are peaceful men and had mostly held off attempted purges by the ninjas in the past by divine intervention from the FSM.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>But now the FSM had forsaken them for their digressions.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>Furthermore, they had grown fat and pathetic, perpetually drinking rum and boning wenches, and were in no shape for battling ninjas.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>This combined with the ninjas mastery of the dark powers of Science meant the pirates didn’t stand a chance against the coming doom.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>The ninjas spread across the land, slaughtering every pirate they found.</Text>

              <Text>They hunted them down like bilge rats.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>Most cowardly fled out into the sea or drowned their sorrows in rum, waiting for the end.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>Many complained to the FSM and turned against Him for letting this misfortune befall them.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>But some took a stand and proudly fought to the end, knowing that they had brought this upon themselves.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>Others repented and prayed to the FSM to apologize for their wrongdoings.</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>One day, as the Flying Spaghetti Monster hovered in the clouds and looked down upon the modern world after the great public revelation of Bobby Henderson (Pesto Be Upon Him), he noticed, yet again, the great lack of pirates.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>This lack of pirates did make him quite peeved, and so he spake unto the believers “What’s up with the lack of pirates?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>Did I not tell ye that the free-spirited pirates are the most beloved unto me, and instruct ye to pass on a very strong suggestion to the people that they dress in the blessed clothing?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>And the believers, many of whom were big whiners, did respond “But it’s &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; to dress up like a pirate in these modern times!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>There are many unbelievers in the world, who do laugh and scorn our accents and choice of clothing.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Their opinions would not matter but that their prejudices cause us great difficulty in keeping good work to put pasta on the table and not getting unnecessarily martyred.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>“Hmm… I suppose a healthy diet of pasta is a pretty important observance in addition to the regalia, and that not getting killed is pretty important to you.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>You must be able to work for the pasta you need, as I, like a forgetful fish owner, am not a terribly dependable provider of such things.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>I understand that you must be respectful to societal norms in order to do that.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>But there must be some way to recognize my followers, that I may bless them accordingly.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>And how am I to know my followers if not by the omnipresence of flamboyant sea-faring style?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>The believers concurred with their delicious deity that the problem of how the deity may recognize the believer in hiding was very serious, and they promptly nominated members to a Divine Relations committee and accorded them task of solving it.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>“We may have all true believers shave off their left eyebrows!” one committee member cried.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>“Nay, such is crazy talk.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>The believer may be recognized by a small calligraphic tattoo of another wench or pirate’s name on their arse, as this clearly demonstrates he or she had acheived a drunken state of universal acceptance.” said another.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>And the third member spoke, “Well, that’s awfully convenient for ye, isn’t it Chuck?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>Nay, the true Pastafarian in hiding shall don small symbols of their faith under mildly pirate-inspired clothing such that they may show the signs and share the style whilst not betraying mainstream society’s tentative and volatile acceptance.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>But let us also designate a day in each season specifically for the observance of that which is holy and wholesome as pasta and piratedom, since we are so hidden at other times.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>Let us stew the sauce for days on end, and give a portion to mark the entrances of sacred halls in which we gather as a place of free, open-hearted love and acceptance, as well as the possible location of a really awesome party.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>Likewise, whenever and wherever we congregate, the doors shall be with marked with a banner of sauce color as a declaration of intent to our lord and invitation for all others to join in our revelry.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>What are all your thoughts on such an arrangement?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>This seemed like a suitable suggestion to the members of the committee, and many nodded approvingly.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>The FSM suddenly then spoke, giving the committee quite a scare as they had forgotten that he was watching the debate.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>“Okay, that sounds like a good plan.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>Let it be so.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>But before I go, I would have ye remember: Thou must be respectable in public, but amongst yourselves and I there shall be no shame nor deceit, nor scandal nor scorn.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>When the time comes that every man is free, all shall party and revel with their full, unconcealed piratitude.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>And as it is written, so did all this come to pass.</Text>

            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>I am the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Thou shalt have no other monsters before Me. (Afterwards is OK; just use protection.) The only Monster who deserves capitalization is Me! Other monsters are false monsters, undeserving of capitalization.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>Thou ought not do stuff thou already knowest is wrong, like killing, lying, cheating, stealing, etc. Dost thou really need these carved into a rock?</Text>

              <Text>Judge not, for verily it be not thine job neither most likely to be thine business.</Text>

              <Text>Hey, try not to buy too much useless crap, OK?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Be kind unto others whether they are kind unto thou or not, for it maketh thou the better person in most situations, and occasionally it doth piss off an idiot, which is funny unto Your Lord the Sauced One.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Thou ought not consume “cheese” from a green cardboard can, nor ought thou allow such cans into thy homes</Text>

            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>Thou shalt remember that all the peoples of the Earth are equally My Creatures. When thee worship strippers, always show thy monetary appreciation generously. Remember that midgets are Holy unto Me; thou shalt not overlook them.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>Thou ought not take thy Pasta in vein. Or artery, for that matter.</Text>

              <Text>Thou ought ever seek to improve thy Pasta, to more closely approach the Divine Noodliness.</Text>

            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>Thou ought beware those who claim to have achieved Noodly Perfection, for they are False Chefs whose claims of the Perfect Recipe will lead thee astray.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>Thou shalt be amused rather than angered by the words and deeds of idiots; for I am thy Noodly Lord and I have created idiots solely for entertainment purposes, Mine first and thine likewise.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>Vengence belongs only to the Holy One. Should you happen upon a restaurant that serves pasta that is not up to the standard of the Holy One, simply deny that restaurant your business in the future. You shall not vandalize, burn, harass, or otherwise disturb the peace.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>Thou ought to taste beyond the shell of the tortellini, and into the cheesy fillings.</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>The True Believers did grow in number and in rank, and there was word spread that a great accounting should take place; a census should be taken and in that census should be counted all the men and the males among them, and all the women, and the females among them, and the children and the girls and the boys, and the infants.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>And the leaders spoke up among the True Believers and declared that the numbers of the accounting of the census seemed to make sense not, for there was no accounting of the persons with indeterminate gender, and also of the persons who felt themselves to be gender mis-identified, and also, to count the children, then re-count the boy children and the girl children separately seemed to nearly double the numbers, not accounting for the gender non-specific.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>And thus the Great Accounting of the True Believers did begin again, and this time was it done by sorting the males and the females and the children and the gender non-specific, and the numbers were tallied and the numbers and ranks of the True Believers seemed to be relatively accurate and the land did feast upon the Holy Meal of the Pasta and Sauce and Orbs made of whatever Protein was the True Believers’ Choice, and the Green Salad was dressed and served and The Tasty Garlic Bread passed.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>The desired beverages were quaffed and there was great fellowship among the counted of the number and the rank of the True Believers.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Afterward, when the plates of the cleaned were gathered, the sweetened desserts of chocolate, dark or milk or white, or not of chocolate at all, but rather simply desserts as the True Believers did prefer, were passed.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>And the True Believers gave great thanks and worship unto the Wise and Holy Flying Spaghetti Monster; the men and the women among them did rejoice, and the children, both the male children and the female, and the infants did rejoice, and the gender non-specific.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>All rejoiced and gloried in the Wisdom and Greatness of the One True Creator who made All That Is and Should Be Taught as Science.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>Each and all among the number and the rank were sated; their hunger was sated and their thirst was quenched, and they were glad and tired.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>For their numbers had been counted with relative accuracy and among them were many; 6354 were the men and 7364 were the women and 25366 were the children and 3907 were the gender non-specific regardless of age.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>And they did look upon one another, and finally it was asked: What was the point of all that, then?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>And came the answer from On High: “I’m not quite sure, but it was one heck of a party!”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>At the rising of the sun the next morning, as the True Believers did awaken, the men among them did arise, and the women and the children and the gender non-specific did arise, a great non-threatening yet thundering voice did call down from On High: “My Children Whom I Have Touched, Who Are Caressed By My Noodly Appendage, it is My wish for you that you live long and happily, and should have great good fun and gain much knowledge and use the brain I have given you and the free will I have given you and the discount shopping coupons and library cards I have given you.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>And then a great sigh did rumble throughout the Earth and throughout the Sky and throughout all Creation.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>“But,” continued the Wiggly Lord, “I figure I ought to include for you a few specifics in case of emergency.”</Text>

            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>The holy scribes did run for their hammers and their chisels and their tablets of stone, and began to hammer furiously away in the ancient languages of the day.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>They did endeavor to catch all the words of the Great Flying Spaghetti Monster as accurately as possible, and with few mistakes, for they wanted to please him, and make him happy.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>They wanted not to incur His Wrath.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>They did hammer and did pound and the chips of granite did collect at their feet and this transcribing they tried to do with much accuracy, for there was not, in those olden times of stone tablets, spell-check nor auto correct nor copy-paste.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>They did live in dark times indeed, and hungered for the wisdom of the Holy Flying Pasta One.</Text>

              <Text>Thusly they wrote, for this he spake:</Text>

              <Text>And it shall be that no eating of boogers shall occur in the market place, the classroom, the gas station, the fast-food restaurant, or the car while sitting at a red light, or in any other place.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>This is His Noodly Word, and for to break it, the offender shall sacrifice three slices of mushroom pizza upside down upon the altar of the offender’s own coffee table.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>There those slices shall remain until such time as do appear small gnats.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>Then and only then is the offender considered cleansed of his booger-sin, and may dispose of the mushroomed slices, and shall sin no more.</Text>

              <Text>If such a man is found to be in possession of said offensive beasts, the beasts will be taken by the True Believers, and they shall be ritually sacrificed upon the garbage heap after much dismemberment.</Text>

            <Verse Number="27">

              <Text>Should his girlfriend be the presenter of the beasts, she should be sternly told to grow up, and instructed by the elder males among the True Believers about appropriate gifts for boyfriends, for yea and verily, she is freakin’ clueless.</Text>

            <Verse Number="31">

              <Text>The scratching of the most private parts or retrieval of the undergarments from the depths of the nether-regions shall be reserved for times when the True Believer has excused him/herself from the company of others, or such time as the True Believer wears the uniform of the team of a professional baseball player, and is on national television.</Text>

              <Text>For the breaking of this sacred law, the penalty shall be that all those True Believers present and in observance shall loudly proclaim “Dude, quit scratching your (insert chosen offensive slang word here)” while pointing at the unholy offender.</Text>

            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>All good pirates owe a duty to Him to have the shaggest and most unkept of beards. However, this duty is not binding, for He, in His infinite wisdom, caused some to be unable to fulfill such a duty in several manner of ways; but yea, I say unto thee, those of the utmost pirate grit will be looked upon with the highest favor by Him for all thine days, and thine cup shall overrun with His most choosen and blessed of pasta.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>On Holy Friday, all good pirates, owe a duty to display their unkept and shaggy beards in the public squares, and marketplaces, and all manner of buffet style restaurants, and dwelling places in which ferminted drink is served with vigor, and unto thine strippers, for they truly are of His essence and beloved by Him. By doing this, His glory is displayed to all, the believer and the non-believer, the principal and the agent, the cobbler of shoes and the huntsmen of the field.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>I say unto you, all good pirates owe a duty unto Him to not remove any manner of debris from thine unkept beard, for yee shall not look upon such debris as a burden, but a blessing from His bounty bestowed unto you from Him for His greater glory. And it is the greatest blessing from on high, to have the wonderous fruit of His wonderful noodly appendage, the most savory, most tantalizing, sacred pasta to become so embedded in thine pirate beard. And he that turns his back on such a blessing and scoffs the gift given unto them, bestowed from Him, then I say unto them, it would be better to have never been bearded, for unless there exists unto them, good cause, for such disrespect for His bounty, it will as if they were cutoff from His goodness and set adrift on the high seas.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>And it became revealed unto me, through His divine, magical, delicious, plan, that all good pirates, in the course of their duty, owe a duty unto Him, when, on Holy Friday, they are in the public squares, and marketplaces, and all manner of buffet style restaurants, and dwelling places in which ferminted drink is served with vigor, to bestow unto thine most favored winch, a kiss for all those present to see, for, when yee do this, it is a proclimation of His glory.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>No good pirate should brandish thine cutlass, or thine hook, or thine peg, nor any manner of implimentation bestowed unto him by Him, nor act in such a way with malice aforethought to thine fellow creatures, which are all part of His magical, delicious, plan, for, in so doing, thine treat thine fellow creatures contrary to His magical, delicious, plan; unless yee be acting to prevent some greater evil that is exceedingly hostile to His plan, or, if the consumption of strong drink has rendered yee unaccountable unto Him for thine acts and thou hast felt the greatest of sorrow for thine transgressions against Him.</Text>

Oh Parmegiana. Oh humble flaky shards of yellow.Oh miniscule specks of flavoursome flake.2. Thy humble origins do thus beginwith thy specially nourished cow.3. Send forth much milk to create theeoh beast of the moo moo. 4. Be thee storedin large vats producing fermented wheyand be thee stored in thy copper cauldron.5. Speed forth thy bacterial culture to sour thee. 6. Then following thy heating to 30-35 degrees celcius,speed forth thy coagulation and formation of curds.7. And following thy placing in form, immerse theein briney water and season thee. 8. And followingthy placing on the supermarket shelves, shall the wheelsof my shopping trolley speed me to the delicatessen section.9. And there shall I purchase thee. 10. Yea verily,shall I get a move on to the ’8 items or less’express checkout, for the woman in frontwith 2 trolleys shall be feeding an army. 11. Then, following purchase of your sacred block,shall I grate thee into a separate bowland store thee in preparation of the holy meal.For thy pre-grated can form is but a smelly abomination.12. Oh golden dandruffy accompaniment.When thy spoon does transport thee to the holy meal,shall thy flakes thus fall through the ribbony noodlesof delight, melt with the sacred mince and mergewith thy venerable garlic and onion seasoning. 13. For thy cheesy holiness beams forthon top of the sacred meal like Hillaryon top of Mt Everest. 14. And whenst thy noodlesreach my mouth after many messy attempts,including use of a man-bib,shall thy flakes impart their flavour upon thee. 15. And thenshall ye descend my clogged oesophagus, blockedby your holy goodness. 16. Following much aching tummyand Alka-Seltzer, send forth much expulsion of thy massive burp.17. For thy burp shall be a gassy expression of your cheesy goodness.18. Yea then and only then shall I feel truly holyand truly fulfilled. For yours is the cheesiness, the powderand the gluttony. For ever and ever. RAmen &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm VIII — Ode to Thy Man-Bib&lt;/strong&gt; 1. Thou eyes hath stared at thine office clockall morning, thus waiting for nourishment.2. For thine office buddies shall congregateat thy local pasta house for lunch. 3. And dressed in full suit and tie, do I order theeSpaghetti, most holy of mealsand expensive bottle of red. 4. And in thine anticipation,following previous drunken messy incidents,thou waiter has brought me forth thy great friend. 5. For hastily tied to the back of my neckis my great saviour and protector. 6. Thy Man-Bib- most holy covering of pastafarian businessmen. 7. Blessed be thy coverage, for thy mince meatshall not stain my Pierre Cardin suit. 8. Blessed bethy cloaking, for thy noodle shall not sullymy Yves St Laurent tie.9. Blessed be thy shelter,for thy parmesan shall not land on my lap.10. For thy Armani shall wear not the holy mealwith thy cloaking. 11. And thy Calvin Klineshall be untouched by the sacred morsels. 12. For thine wondrous Man-Bibhas saved me from a fate worse than death.13. The wrath of mine wife and local drycleaner14. And shall thee dwell around my neckduring many a business lunch.Forever and ever. RAmen &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm IX — The Holy Ponderance&lt;/strong&gt; 1. Oh Great Noodly One. To thee I doth ponder,for thy presence inspires much rumbling of my tummy.2. And after repeated rumbling and grumblingof thy digestive system, shall I sunder forthto the Holy Refrigerator in search of your fulfilment.3. And after much fumbling and bumblingthrough the empty shelves, shall I surrenderthy wishful thinking and retreat to the holy ATMto replenish thy monetary stocks. 4. And then I do doth speed, doing 100 in a 60 km/h zoneto the local supermarket during peak hour,for thy weekly chores must be done. 5. Cashed up and readyto do battle with holy trolley and bloated wallet,my grocery vessel doth speed me through Lanes 1 to 6with much haste. For thine aisles are thus blockedwith the slow and indecisive. 6. And thoughtsof previous trolley rage incidents, for which I was imprisoned,doth subside on thy blessed turning into Lane 7. 7. For there before me are the myriads of your many forms.8. Oh Great One, for thy many forms do thus inspirea holy hypnosis. 9. And there do I stand mid-aisle to ponderthy many forms. 10. And Lane 7 doth turn into a massive log jamon the initiation your holy ponderance…</Text>

RAmen. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XI&lt;/strong&gt; 1 I know that you are probably getting tiredof me, but I remembered that last nightBill O’Reilly said in his commentarythat banning ideas like Intelligent Designis nothing short of Fascism. 2 I have written to thank himfor his support of alternative theories, ssuch as FSM, in science classand encouraged him to mention FSMmore directly in the future. 3 I think that it would be usefulif others also send an emailto him expressing gratitude for the supportof such a high profile individualfor our humble cause. 4 Think of the reactionif he became angry at a thousand FSM emails. 5 LOL. Still LOL. 6 Having too much fun with the imageof him denying endorsement of FSMwith little flecks of foamat the corners of his mouth…. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XII&lt;/strong&gt; 1 After following the antics of the Kansas school boardfor some time, I was finally fortunate enough to find your sitethrough the third page of links on Google News.2 What can I say; I just love reading about the comedic pratfallsof George Bush. 3 I felt a brush of sauce-based enlightenmentwhen I read about the great wonderfulness of the Flying Spagetti Monster. 4 I believe I have found my calling and I would like to become a Priestordained in the faith of the FSM. 5 Specifically,I’d like to get some kind of certificate to put on my wallso I can call pasta dinners Communion and have an excuseto dress up like a pirate and request Fridays off. 6 I don’t thinkI’ll get Fridays off, but I think eye patches are cool. 7 I’d also like to officiate over gay unions. Lots and lots of gay unions. 8 I feel that the FSM would appreciate this, since It has a lot of noodly appendagesand would want us mere humans created in It’s image with noodly appendagesto get together and attempt to procreate. 9 I’m also cool with lesbian weddingsbecause the FSM also respects those created with more meatball-like attachments.10 And if the meatballs and noodles want to get together, it’s all goodbecause the FSM is cool about that. 11 Unlike some imaginary deitieswho are such prudes they don’t even have sex with women to get kids,the FSM has the meatballs and noodles all coming togetherout in the open in a free expression of high-carb goodness. 12 By the way, does the carb-content of the FSMmean that Atkins is the anti-FSM and deserving of scorn? 13Anyway. 14 Please let me know how I can become a priest in the FSM faith.15 I’d be happy to spread the word and post the 10 Ingredients in courthousesand other public buildings and claim they are historic. 16 I have jury dutyin a few weeks so there’s an opportunity right there. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XIII&lt;/strong&gt; 1.

Unto you, too,be touched, be filled, be blessed, believe! &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XIV&lt;/strong&gt; 1Alas, my blind eyes have been opened!2My life has complete meaningand direction now. For decades3I thought I was the odd one 4and have grappled to understandmy fixation 5with pasta and pirate attire.6Little did my feeble mind realizethat it was all part of a grand plan 7and I was merely and instrument of HIM.8Praise the Flying Spaghetti Monster!9Hallowed be his His Noodly Appendages! &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XV&lt;/strong&gt; 1I have been on a search2all of my life for the truthabout my existence.3I believe HE has visited memany times in my dreams. 4I long for the day when HEwill send down cheese5from the heavens6much like others have claimedto have found manna. 7Thank you for your workand continued vigilance!8May we all continuein the sauce of life! &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XVI&lt;/strong&gt; 1I was deeply touched by your letterto the Kansas School Board.2Clearly His Noodly Appendageis upon you, 3magnifying your spiritof greatness,4and gilding your tonguewith precious metals. 5I can tell by your faiththat you must be a great patriot as well.6That your religious fervoris wrapped in the gooey goodnessof the flag. 7After all, does notits red and white stripes truly standfor the white pasta of purityand the red sauce of robust life force? 8And the white starson the blue background,9are they not representative of his children,10the beloved chicken-n-stars, 11the great soupof our nation, 12with their little starchy soulsglittering in the heavens,13at the great spaghetti dinnerfound in the end times. 14Surely only the chosenwill be whisked up to heaven15to soak in a bowl of fresh squeezed chicken juice,16while the rest are left to languishin their low carb life, 17forced to subsiston fad diets of vanity and evil desire. 18Let he with the unstained shirt, cast the first bowl!19Because only the Flying Spaghetti Monstercan sift the angel hair from the fettuccini.20No Flying Spaghetti Monster, No Peace.21Know Flying Spaghetti Monster, and Know Peace. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XVII&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; 1. Your most humble servant, that I2. Might become a waiter on high3. Serving your immutable word4. To diners. 5. I wear white today, that I6. Might be graced by the slight magenta hues7. Of pureed tomato, with basil, and garlic8. As between bites I spill your blessed sauceliness9. Upon my blouse. 10. Another helping, please, that I11. Might munch gratefully12. In abject reverence13. For two eternities. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XVIII&lt;/strong&gt; 1. As I gaze upon my2. Plate of exquisite aroma3. And subtle flavor4. I cannot but wonder,5. What is this spice that6. My good lord7. Has placed before me.8. His words appear like a mighty fire9. In the sky10. “Eat the dish that I will show you11. The dish you do not know12. And you shall win at life.”13. I nibble. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XIX&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; 1. Who can know the multitude of2. Raveled knots3. Of the Lord’s manifest4. Starchiness?5. Who can know the infinitesimal6. Time, the precision7. Of boil, required for a8. Holy al Dente?9. Who can know the annual10. Carbohydrates consumed per11. Capita in exotic lands12. Like Norway, and Yemen?13. The Lord, in his eternal noodality,14. Knows, and grants us life15. That we may ask, and wonder, and16. Praise. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XX&lt;/strong&gt; 1. Blessed is the chef2. who cooks only in kitchens of brick3. and serves his labor to your loving mother;4. His delight is in the sauce of the Puttanesca5. that he might one day imbibe its pleasures; 6. He is like a meatball fondled by the tiny hands of youth,7. before it is seasoned8. and tenderized9. and baked; 10. Not so the diners!11. They could not discern the highest cuisine12. From the lowest serving of Hamburger Helper; 13. Therefore the diners will not stand in judgment,14. nor the critics in contempt; 15. For the LORD watches over the makers of delicious16. That their dishes stay delicious for eternity. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XXI&lt;/strong&gt; 1. I waited patiently for his Noodliness;2. he turned to me and heard my cry.3. He lifted me out of the boiling hell4. out of the steel and bubbling waters5. he poured me into a strainer6. and placed the finest butter in my knots7. A brief shake, and then8. He set me down upon a gilded plate9. Dressed my countenance in the choicest parmesan10. And sent me forth into the gullets of believers. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XXII&lt;/strong&gt; 1. Blessed is the man of faith!2. For the Lord shalt hasten his pot’s boil3. And guard against the sinful foam4. That rises up on the stove of the sinner 5. Blessed is the man of faith!6. The man who shelves his egg-timers and stopwatch7. And trusts the Lord to whisper softly in his tender ear8. When his Prophet, Muhammad al-Dente, emerges from the froth:9. The harbinger of peace, harmony, and damn good taste. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XXIII&lt;/strong&gt; 1 The Flying Spaghetti Monster is my chef; I shall not want. 2 He maketh me to sit down at full tables: he leadeth me beside the busy kitchens. 3 He restoreth my appetite: he leadeth me in the paths of excellent cuisine for his name’s sake. 4 Arr, though I walk through the kitchen of the empty cupboards, I will fear no hunger: for thou art with me; thy noodles and thy meatballs they comfort me. 5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my meal with sauce; my platter runneth over. 6 Surely flavor and deliciousness shall follow me all the minutes of my supper: and I will dwell in the dining room of the Flying Spaghetti Monster forever. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XXIV&lt;/strong&gt; 1Oh! Mighty Midgit (sic)2The smell of Beef wafts to my nostrils of my nose.3 Behold! My nose hears words of Meatballs4 (And There Shall be but Two Meatballs,5 for three meatballs are an abomination, and verily!)6 Kansas shall permit scripture to be taught in Science Class!7 Glory unto the State Board of Education!8 Holy is Bobby (for he is the Chosen Prophet of the Noodley One,9 Who is Unseen (and Invisible)10 And Flies11 And Has Two Meatballs12 And Eyes13 Let me be touched by His Noodley Appendage!14 Let me be inspired by his Marinara!15 Let me smell the Oregano on his breath!18 And The Basil in his Sauce17 Anoint me in Olive Oil18 And dress me in Full Pirate Regalia!19 Lead me to Garlic!20 (And my Parrot, also, verily!)21 I beseech you , oh Durum Semolina Master22 Forgive me (Although I be not worthy!) &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pastalm XXV — &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Lament of Linguini&lt;/strong&gt; 1. And He toucheth me as he doth touch thy midgit.2. Yea how I lament thy loss at not being touched by Him3. As He toucheth only thy midgit.4. Thou art good and kind in thy gift of Linguini in honour of Him5. And how I wisheth that He hath seen thy gift to Him. 6. For He hath been known to be fickle in His touching7. And misseth thee from His list.8. For thou art inventive in thy pasta9. And doeth all He requireth of thee.10. Yea how I lament thy loss. 11. Do not wail at thy loss12. As thou art strong in thy reserve13. And deserveth not to be seen by thy admirers as such.14. For may he once look up from His mighty beer mug15. And see thy pain and touch thee.</Text>

              <Text>They looked upon one another in the vast multitudes gathered there, and finally one spoke for she was wise among them:</Text>

              <Text>Normal talking will do just fine.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>“Alright, we’re sorry,” they said, in a less deafening rumble.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>“That’s a little better, but not much,” said the wise one.</Text>

              <Text>“Let me introduce myself. I am the First of the Dee Dees,</Text>

            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>My descendents will spend many late nights wandering the Forums of the Internet, making comments and settling disagreements, and occasionally smacking around the idiotic.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>A distant hand arose in the crowd.</Text>

            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>“You there,” said Dee Dee the First, pointing her out, “Did you have a question?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>“Um, yes, begging your pardon, ma’am, but what is the Internet?” asked a woman nearly lost in the crowd.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>“Good question,” answered Dee Dee the First,</Text>

            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>“and I wish I could answer, but I do not yet know.</Text>

              <Text>All I can tell you is this; Our Great Noodly Lord Touched Me with His Appendage in the night”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>The crowd made a low eeewwww sound, for some interpreted this with jealousy, others interpreted it as naughtiness, and others as icky.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>“Behave Yourselves!” said Dee Dee the First with a stomp of her foot.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>“This is just what The Flying Spaghetti Monster warned me about.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>He Touched me and told me that for generations, people of all sorts would be unruly, and for some reason I and my descendents would have to keep them in line.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>She sighed a sigh audible far and wide among the True Believers.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>“On that note, He also told me that among the True Believers there is great wisdom, and that it should be gathered together, and that some poor sap would volunteer to write it all down.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>“I have a bunch of stone tablets and a chisel,” came a distant and smarty-pants voice from the back of the crowd.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="29">
              <Text>“You then. I guess you’re the one,” said Dee Dee the First.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="30">
              <Text>A great and painfully deafening cheer sounded forth from the gathered True Believers.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="31">
              <Text>Among the cheer, both Dee Dee the First and the scribe could swear they were able to discern people saying</Text>

              <Text>“Sucker!”</Text>

            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="35">
              <Text>“Would you ALL stop shouting!,” yelled Dee Dee the First.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="36">
              <Text>“You do NOT want to see me get angry!”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="37">
              <Text>“Well I guess I could start to organize it, you know, not really put it all together myself then be responsible for all the communication about it and everything”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="38">
              <Text>said the woman who was known among the True Believers as Solipsy The Self-Important.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="39">
              <Text>“Um, I guess I don’t have much else to do anyways, and it would be cool if I could get a fancy title and stuff.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="40">
              <Text>Could I get a fancy title?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="41">
              <Text>“I’ll see what I can do,” answered Dee Dee the First.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="42">
              <Text>“In the meantime, go forth into the masses, and gather together the wisdom that exists among them.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="43">
              <Text>Translate it without doing too much damage to its overall intent,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="44">
              <Text>and please, whatever else you do try not to make an idiot out of yourself.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="45">
              <Text>Laughter arose from the crowd for some had encountered Solipsy and knew her smarty-pants nature and the chances she would sometimes make an idiot out of herself.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="46">
              <Text>Solipsy sighed. “Thank you, Dee Dee the First. I shall try to serve Our Lord Glob with all my heart,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="47">
              <Text>and produce a Holy Text that reflects His Greatness and complies with the wishes of the Great Prophets, past, present, and future.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="48">
              <Text>Another hand arose in the crowd. Dee Dee the First pointed to the man raising it. “Yeeesss?” she said. “What is it now?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="49">
              <Text>“How can a person comply with the wishes of a future prophet?” the man asked.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="50">
              <Text>“As with all religious texts,” pointed out Dee Dee the First, “this one is confusing and obscure, with inherent contradictions, for it is the inspired and gathered lore of a religious people over time.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="51">
              <Text>Any more silly questions before we begin the book of ProvHerbs?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="52">
              <Text>“No,” whispered the chastised crowd.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="53">
              <Text>And with that the account of the scribing of the wise ProvHerbs did begin: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Chapter Two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 1Many were the True Believers, and both great and silly was the wisdom among them. 2Either way, heed, O Pastafarians this advice, for to ignore it would be most unwise and a bummer to the Great and Wheat-Based Protein-Orbed Creator of All That There Is. 3He has inspired many, who shall be cited en masse at the end of the book of ProvHerbs. 4Pastafarians have always been a smart bunch, and the Noodly Glob in Beer Volcano and Stripper Factory Heaven knoweth that they will until eternity understand the clumsy nature of putting every name alongside every ProvHerb, and how that would kill the overall comic effect of this section of the Holy Book. 5Truly, great is the wisdom among the inspired True Believers, and the scribe Solipsy did invite the inspired to form an orderly line and spill forth that wisdom, 6for she was excessively over-controlling. 7After such a time had passed that a quantity of the wisdom had been gathered, the scribe brought it before a Council of the Elders among the Pastafarians. 8She entered the Great Hall, and on the table before her was the Holy Meal which no Pastafarian refuses another, 9and afterward was much irrelevant and tiresome discussion, 10and some hours later a platter of doughnuts was brought forth. 11Finally, it was the scribe’s turn to speak. “O Wise Ones, I present to you the wisdom of the Pastafarian Believers, which I have gathered as you have asked.” 12“Didst thee also check it for spelling errors?” the elders asked of her. 13She hung her head in shame. “No, I did not.” 14A great cry came issued from among them, and the doughnuts were removed. 15“Check these documents and bring them back in suitable condition that we may sort them and adjudicate them as worthy for inclusion in our Holy Book!” they yelled. 16The scribe left without her treasured doughnut, muttering words forever lost to history. 17For many more days and nights she toiled, chiseling out the bad spellings and grammar, 18and sorting the advice of the inspired Pastafarians into broad categories so that the Council would look upon her with favor. 19The scribe was determined that when next she brought the texts before the council, the doughnut of crÃ¨me filling and chocolate-frosted top would be her prize. 20In due course, she was convinced the Texts were presentable, and she brought them forth again. 21Same sh* “ouch” scene, different day. 22Only this time, the Elders looked upon the corrected ProvHerbs, pronounced some of them Canon, and sorted them into final categories. 23Thus did the scribe receive her doughnut, and further instructions to finalize them and present them to the Pastafarian tribes of the True Believers. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Chapter Three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; So began the amassed wisdom of the ProvHerbs: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advice on Cooking, Eating &amp; Enjoying Tasty Pasta:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt; 1Faith is to the soul what sauce is to pasta. 2The meaning of life can only be found at the bottom of a pasta bowl. 3To the divine feast, the wise bringeth TicTacs, but the fool leaveth with breath most garlicky and offensive. 4And once the garlic has been in the sauce, yea verily, thou must brush your tongue as well as your teeth, before thou layest with your wench. 5Starch not the shirts nor the linens, for starch is a holy foodstuff and should be consumed with reverence – and a good sauce. 6He who eats pasta shall never be hungry. 7There is never a right way to overcook pasta. 8As long as we eat our pasta and do not overcook it, we shall be saved. 9Feed a man pasta and you have fed him for a day, teach a man to cook pasta and you will amaze his wife. 10The wise Believer checketh the date of the Parmesan, but the foolish accidentally flavor the sauce with mold. 11Whoever tops with the cheese of the powder is a blasphemer, sayeth the Lord. 12Do not put ranch dressing on your spaghetti, for that is blasphemy. 13Abhor ye not the dried pasta, for verily it is written that only the stuff in tins is an abomination. 14His Noodliness helps those who help themselves to seconds! &lt;strong&gt;How to Pleasingly Praise Our Lord the Flying Spaghetti Monster:&lt;/strong&gt; 15If thy sauce falleth in thy lap, sing praise that His Noodleyness has spareth’ed thy new shag pile. 16To touch the divine, is not the same as being divinely touched. 17He shall cover thee with his spaghetti, and under his marinara shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy parmesian and meatballs. 18I can do all things through FSM who marinates me.19 Please prepare your plates, let us eat. Pass the Parmesan. 20As you treat the least of the midgets, so you treat Him. 21He who doubteth me shall sip warm diet drinks fortified with caramel coloring and artificial sweetener forever: But he who believeth in me shall drink his fill from the beer volcano and the Holy Wine Bar. &lt;strong&gt;How to Treat Others and Great Advice In General:&lt;/strong&gt; 22If you can’t say anything nice, fill up your mouth with pasta. Yum! 23Everyone is kneaded out of the same dough but not cooked in the same pot. 24Better the mushroom you know than the fungus you don’t know. 25A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up pasta sauce. 26A friend in need is a friend who has not been touched. 27A closed mouth catches no noodly appendages. 28You may forget with whom you laughed, but you will never forget the pirates with whom you ate pasta. 29Where no spaghetti is, the people fall: but in the multitude of pastas there is safety. 30Let he who is without arms, cast the first stone. 31When a thief sees the Noodley One, all he sees are His pockets. 32Love thy neighbor as thyself, and share pasta and rum drinks galore, for in the eyes of His Noodlitude, we are all One. 33Let us love, not in word or speech, but in pasta and wine. 34Kiss the cook. &lt;strong&gt;Beatitudes:&lt;/strong&gt; 35With Him, All Things are Pasta-Bowl. 36FSM answered, It is written:’Man does not live on bread alone, but on every pasta that comes from the mouth of me. 37Cook pasta for others, as you would have them cook pasta for you. 38As a child I slurped noodles as a child, dribbled sauce as a child, and threw meatballs as a child. Now I see through the sauce darkly, and speak with the tongues of pirates, and all is sound and blurry if I have not love. 39Faith, hope, and noodles; and of these, the greatest is noodles. 40It is easier for a meatball to pass through the eye of a tornado than for a confused man to enter the Kingdom of Pasta. 41Punish not those but for a noodle for a noodle, a meatball for a meatball. 42Strive for the stars, for nothing is impastable. 43Pray for the things you want, but work for the pasta you need. 44Thou shall continue on the path of the great noodly one, through both thick marina sauce and thin marinara sauce. 45Those who ask for seconds will be provided, those with no appetite for the lord shall feel His hunger. 46Those who eat pasta shall inherit the earth. 47Let he who is without seasoning, cast the first pinch of basil. 48Noodle unto others as you would have them noodle unto you. &lt;strong&gt;How to Live Well:&lt;/strong&gt;</Text>

              <Text>was changed by him. I raised up the mainsail; and my hands held belaying pins,</Text>

              <Text>and the timbers with sweet smelling tar, upon the planks of the deck. I opened the hatch; but my skipper had withdrawn himself, and8. was gone: our course changed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. The watchmen that went about the crows-nest found me, they smote me,8. they wounded me; the keepers of the mast took away my eyepatch from me. I charge you, O wait-staff of Olive Garden, if ye find my skipper,9. that ye tell him, that I am sick of being mistreated. What is thy shipmate more than another swab, O thou scurviest10. among dogs? What is thy skipper more than another sea-dog, that thou dost so charge us? My skipper is drunk and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.11. His hat is as the most fine tricorn, his beard is bushy, and12. black as a raven. His eye (the one without the patch) is as the eye of a parrot by the mizzen-mast,13. shot with blood, and fitly set. His cheeks are woven with fuse-cord, as intimidating as a burning face: his lips14. like caterpillars, drooling smelly rum. His ears wear gold rings set with the beryl: his waistcoat is as15. bright satin stuffed with loaded pistolas. His left leg is as a pillar of pine, set upon the stump of his16. thigh: his countenance is as Davy Jones Locker, strewn with debris and wreckage. His mouth is most foul: yea, he is altogether vile. This ismy skipper, and this is my friend, O wait-staff of Olive Garden.</Text>

            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>So I instructed this false priest of my wishes, albeit in the awful dialect of Tacobeania, a lingo that resembles Espan(ol.</Text>

            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>And thus spake he: “O stranger, thou must know this: Antonio’s joint hath changed ownership more than twice; I strive to serve foods which are clean in the eyes of our own regional gods ‘Taco and Enchilada.’ But I wish your God ‘Pasta’ (sneer, snicker) a very happy landing.”</Text>

            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>“But, stranger unto our land and customs,” he then added, “my heart is not made of river rock. Mayhap the harlot–uh, cook, Juanita, can find a handful of forgotten spaghetti in some nook or cranny; behold, I may yet persuade her to cook a sauce for thee…say, doest thou like beans?” So spoke the heathen who served unto the false gods ‘Taco’ and ‘Enchilada.’ Woe unto them.</Text>

            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>And behold! The parquet floor shifted and all chairs and tables trembled. Oh, fearful sight! A mountain of flesh came unto my table; and–behold–it was the part-time cook: Juanita.</Text>

            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>And such were the consequences which had resulted from the ingestion of unholy foods: she was as broad as she was tall, and thus her form appeared to be spherical.</Text>

            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>The words of an English bard came to mind: “Marry, sir, she is the kitchen-wench, and all grease; and I know not what use to put her to, but to make a lamp of her, and run from her by her own light.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>And behold, her protruding belly supported two bowls, and those bowls she topped off with the lower pair of her four enormous breasts. In her entirety she fully resembled the legendary four-breasted harlot of Phoenix. And woe! that she was.</Text>

            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>And lo, from her first bowl she served me a dish of ersatz-pasta and hamburger helper and salsa. Behold, the second bowl was empty.</Text>

            <Verse Number="19">

            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>Lo, the mountain of flesh held her empty bowl beneath my chin; and I understood this to be her subtle hint that I should place a substantial offering into that vessel; therefore I searched my purse for some loose shekels, whereupon she frowned; and then she spoke:</Text>

            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>“Fie, stranger, it is not thy monetary reward that I wouldst cherish; but pray, why pukest and fartest thou not? Hath my food not been to thy liking?”</Text>

            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>I refused to oblige her, and thus she retreated with nothing more than one clean bowl in her hand. (Lord, who can understand these heathens’ ways?)</Text>

              <Text>Lord Pasta! I cry out to Thee for deliverance from exile; for I crave Thy Pasta; Thy Sauce and Thy Meatballs. I have been good; am I not Thine obedient Pastafarian? Exile me, O Pasta, if Thou wilt, to Chicago; or to Cleveland; even to Milwaukee; anywhere; for there, Thy Pastafarians shall serve Thee well.—————————————————————————————————— &lt;strong&gt;Book TWO&lt;/strong&gt; 1Woe unto me, for I still live in the land of heathenish Tacobeanians. Verily, the displeasure of Our Lord FSM is still upon me.2Behold, I consort with one of their most-vile denizens: the aforementioned four breasted harlot of Phoenix; yea.3And lo, it came to pass that she entered into my kitchen (for she desired to learn about my Lord Pasta and His Condiments and His Meatballs).4And, Lord Pasta forgive me, I ogled her four stupendous breasts in amazement, for never before had my eyes beheld more than three breasts on any female body. Lord, for viewing that abomination, yea, I rightly deserve fifty lashes with Thy Noodle.5And it came to pass that she desired to learn how to make Thy Blessed Meatball, and so I shewed her how to prepare Thy Balls of Protein.6“Much-esteemed four-breasted harlot of Phoenix,” I said unto this heathen, “first thou takest of the following:7One pound of hallowed ground beef; 1/2 cup of bread crumbs; one egg that thou first beatest lightly; ½ cup of sacred Spaghetti Sauce; 1 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of onion flakes. Then thou mixest the entire Holy Shebang and shapest It into 1 inch Holy Balls. Thou bakest His Sacred Balls in a pan, in a preheated oven at 400 degrees, but for no more and no less than 20 minutes shalt thou bake Them. “8“O Master of thine own oven,” spoke the four-breasted harlot of Phoenix. “Woe is me, for I have kneaded one of my contact lenses into the Holy Mix. See? it lieth here upon the surface of His Meatball.”9“Behold,” I replied, “do not distress thyself, gracious harlot. Cook this, thine Holy Ball and consume It along with the lens; for then Our Vision-enhanced Holy Meatball shall fully see thine innermost self as He passeth through thee. Yea, He will see everything, including the taco.”———————————————————————&lt;strong&gt;Book THREE&lt;/strong&gt; 1Woe unto the four-breasted harlot of Phoenix! Her filthiness is in her skirts; alas, clean laundry hath not yet been delivered to my abode; for here she now resideth. But who am I to look for flaws in her? Behold; I am not the cleanest myself.2Yea, even she is an abomination in the eyes of her people, and she existeth at a pariah level equal to mine; but she pitieth me, for I am a foreign lowlife here in Tacobeania.3Behold, she inquired: “Wouldst thou not show me, O master of thine electric oven, how even I, a common harlot, might make fine spaghetti from plain dough?”4“Hush, gentle harlot,” thus spoke I. “Spaghetti derives from Holy Dough; therefore thou must, when thou speakest of Lord Pasta, capitalize the first letter in His Name, yea, and even those which are found in all adjectives and all such which stand afore It; for they greatly serve to glorify His Holy Doughy Entity; verily, such reverence pleases Him mightily.”5 “But let us not dally, for we must make Spaghetti from Holy Dough, but no more and no less than is required to sate the hunger of one Pastafarian and his heathen consort.”6Behold! Thou takest two cups of flour and two eggs, no more, no less; for so it is written. Thou addest one T. of salt; next thou takest ½ cup of water at room temperature and addest it to the previous. Thou mixest it well until it is on the firm side; it shall be neither soft nor hard. And, behold; there is The Holy dough.7Then thou kneadest His Holy Dough on a well-floured board, and then thou shalt cover It for some time. 7. Now thou kneadest thine Holy Dough on a well-floured board, and then thou shalt cover It for some time.8Take thy knife, oh, harlot, and cut His Starchy Dough into manageable sections. Well done!9Next thou rollest each of These Doughy Portions into a Holy Ball.10Behold, now thou rollest each Ball into a Sacred Circle of no more than 1/2 cubit in diameter; and His Thickness shall be between ¼ inch to ½ inch.11Next thou takest thine Holy Disks and rollest Them through the rollers of thy Spaghetti machine for the desired final thickness.12Yea, now thou runnest His Holy Circles through thy purified Spaghetti cutters and hangest His Strands up to dry”13Great Pasta! Behold, that heathen woman hath placed Thine Holy Spaghetti into a seething pot of water and cooked it for two hours.14And woe, she said unto me: “Ees theees whadda coooked spaghettees shou’d loook like, huh?”15Woe, all Thy Strands have jelled into a pasty two-inch layer. Woe, and woe! she then proceeded to slice a pocket into this glutinous lump and defiled it with pinto beans and such.16And the four-breasted harlot of Phoenix found Thy desecrated representation to be exquisite in flavor; and woe, she renameth the ‘The Mighty Gordita.’17Lord Pasta, my heart is heavy; my body no longer lusteth for the harlot; it desireth only Thee. Besides, she is toooooo mucha grande for me. Yea ———————————————————————————————————- &lt;strong&gt;Book FOUR&lt;/strong&gt; 1Oh Lord Pasta, here is a word for the wise: “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.”2Woe is me, for the harlot of Phoenix hath broken my teeth with gravel stones and creased my pate, for I had shewn her the door.3And I said unto her: “Harlot, thou breakest my teeth, thou cuttest off my hair; now my strength and my hope is perished.”4And it came to pass that she mumbled: “Whatever! thou foreign ninny…” And behold, then she rearranged her breasts and, with that out of the way, she gracefully rolled down the porch steps and right out of my life. (Keep on rolling, rolling)5Lord Pasta is merciful in His mysterious ways; hath He not released me from bondage to that heathen behemoth?6Yea, and now I shall go forth and purchase a can of His Preserved Representational Body, for I need to regain my strength; if such is His will. RAmen.——————————————————— &lt;strong&gt;Book FIVE&lt;/strong&gt; 1Lo and woe! Above all, how much longer, Lord Pasta, must I remain in the land of the Tacobeanians?2 My tears have filled the previously dry river bed, the one which our heathens now call ‘The River of Tears.’ For a river of tears it becomes each time thy servant crieth out to Thee for deliverance from exile. Yea! Yea, for such is my great sorrow.3 Behold, I have rent into pieces my finest Gucci shirt and strewn ashes upon my pate. I have given my Lucchese alligator boots to a hobo. What else wouldst Thou that I should offer unto Thee and the local trash heap? My Calphalon Anodized 8-pc. Cookware set?————————————————————————&lt;strong&gt;Book SIX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written after his deliverance from exile and ensuing gluttony.&lt;/em&gt; 1Behold, Lord Pasta, I still cry out to Thee. Mine eyes are once more filled with tears. Woe is me, for I am in gastrointestinal distress: My bowels are troubled; I am bloated; my pyloric valve hath closed up well-nigh permanently; woe, my acid reflux condition hath reached hitherto unknown discomfort levels; I cry out in pain: O FSM, make it feel all better! Woe! woe! even my cats think that I am so full of S* (Spaghetti, that is)! 2Thy smell of garlic and green pepper is still upon me. Woe, woe unto me! The acidity of Thy Plum Tomatoes eats away the protective lining of my stomach; yea, and Thy Meatballs smote me mightily last night; for they contained a pinch of finely grated onions and pepper and salt and Italian seasonings; woe is me! Alas, only the makers of Chico’s Italian Hot Sausages would know for certain what all had been stuffed into their casings; for such mighty meaty links I had (probably blasphemously) added into Thy Simmering Holy Mix and allowed them to fornicate with Thy Meatballs. Woe is me, for even Thy Sauce hath contained too many of Thy Thrice-blest Spices. 3And woe, through my fault, through my fault, through my most-grievous fault, I overindulged in Thy Simmered Condiment which I had so generously poured over Thy Noodly Strands. Mayhap I should have partaken only in the consumption of Thy Farinaceous Appendages? Woe unto me for my reckless self-abandonment to culinary pleasure. Cursed be my palate; yea, I curse Thee and Thy host of taste buds. 4And woe, woe, woe; although Thy Scrumptiousness hath only been a brief foretaste of Thy Pasta Heaven, alas, I fear that I shall enter into Thy Kingdom with all mine earthly afflictions and therewith be doomed to eternally toggle between immeasurable delights and hellish torments. Woe is me ad nauseam. ~~~&lt;em&gt;Fini&lt;/em&gt;~~~</Text>

I’m the Admin, and I know where we keep the extra punctuation!! &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;So there!!!~!!! &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;I bought a box of “!!”’s on sale, so I’m being very generous with them.) &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Cerberus, being young and inquisitive, then inquired (as inquisitive people do): &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;How much for each “!” is it? &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Can you buy other punctuation? &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;And can you buy bulk cause I don’t want to get halfway through the post and realize &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;that I’ve used all my commas. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;That could make things bad. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;REAL bad. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;And Auntie Dee Dee said unto Cerberus &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;The bulk punctuation is in the Moderator’s Klubhowse, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;behind the couch with the hole in the cushion, &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;NOT the couch with the spring that bites yer butt. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;I’ve hidden it in a Twinkies box, &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;and the case of “!!”’s is in the corner with a towel over it, &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;doubling as a table. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;It’s a BIG case of “!!”’s. &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;I have a line on a case of “,” and “’” that they’ve quit using in some forums. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;I’m going to trade them all the “u”’s that the Bushista’s don’t use anymore when they use the word buffoon. &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Someone in their talking points misspelled it bafoon, and now they all do it. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;(Sad, but true. That’s exactly what happened. &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;One little ‘Republiclone’ got it wrong, and there they went like the sheeple they’ve turned into.) &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;So, we’re good on “.” and : and “;” and the “?” box is almost 3/4 full as well. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;If you see a shortage in any punctuation, let me know. Mr. Green &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;And kao, and then Sylvie replied thusly &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;kao, saying: I’m offended that you keep perfectly good punctuation stashed away in boxes and under towels fsm angry &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;Why not release them from their captivity and allow them to become part of something larger then themselves? &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;It’s days like this in which I am glad to not be a punctuation mark. &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;And Sylvie replying: As the Bible clearly points out, man has dominion over punctuation, &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;and it is to be used as man sees fit. &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;Of course we have a responsibility to the plain dumb punctuation mark as well, &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;but it cannot become part of anything larger than itself &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;because punctuation has no culture or civilization of its own. &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;And Auntie Dee Dee Spaketh Unto Them all and said: &lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;If I release the punctuation, it’ll just throw itself all over the forums willy-nilly. &lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;I’m offended that you’d want all that perfectly good pun!!ctuation &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;to wander lost until it found a place to cling to, &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;even if it be!came total!ly irratio()()al in where it went&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*. &lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;Now some of it, wh^^^^ich was restin%%g nicely:;:has gott@@@@@@@@en loose and st!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!arted running aroun——–d in this mes$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$age. &lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;Most of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! is spare o*****************dd pun##tuation &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;that sta%%%%ys with the huge b!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ox of !!s, not the co{{{mmas and p]]]]]eri&amp;&amp;&amp;ods, &lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;but the more es~~~~~ote““““ric stuff++++++. &lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Punct!!uation, left to it”"s self&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; will wander around like \\\a lo!!!st ch^&amp;$ild. &lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;I’m giving it mo**re attenti%%on than usual, bec##ause the f!!orum!!!!s are gro!!ing so&amp;^ fast. &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;It want”’s to be use!!!!d, and will st”art putting it”””””””””s self anywhere unless&amp;&amp;&amp; you fo!!!llow the in$$&amp;(structi!!!ons… &lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt;(Now the periods are getting jealous. I’m so glad punctuation won’t go into parentheses unless it’s put there.) &lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;OK, I stopped and rounded that stuff up. &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;Most!!!! of it is back in the boxes. &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;When the new shipmen!!!!ts come today, it’ll refill the bins. &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Last night, with only the tiny bit we had left, I just gave a MOD some info about the spares!!!!. &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;(I’m going to go after those !!’s with a flyswatter if they don’t GET BACK IN THEIR BOX!!) &lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Nosy Parkers…hmmmmph! &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;That’s better. &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;We’ve had to add these huge bins to the Klubhowse for the punctuation usage around here, &lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;and it was so low last night, I gave C-man the directions to the spares. &lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;Bobby’s given us an open account at the punctuation store, &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;and I’m trying to cut deals for all the extras I can on the grey market. &lt;sup&gt;61&lt;/sup&gt;(It’s real punctuation, just getting piled up for some reason, so I get a good buy on it.) &lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;Every penny helps, especially with the cost of Pixels going up again.</Text>

            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>FSM: &lt;em&gt;First you must remain faithful to me and only me. Why you ask? Because I am cool. Second you can make me offerings, spaghetti, pasta whatever suits your fancy. Thirdly you must promote the word of me but only in moderation, nobody likes a pasta thumper. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>FSM: &lt;em&gt;After that and you have proven yourself will you be able to participate in these sorts of activities. If you purposefully do not do these activities even when reminded by fellow pastafarians, you will be sent to spaghetti hell, which is BAAAAAAAAAAAD! This shall be taken lightly as I am lazy and don’t wanna fill out the paperwork.&lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>FSM: &lt;em&gt;Which brings me to another point,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;</Text>

            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Paperwork is the spawn of ninja! Those who like paperwork are petty buerocrats who like cubicles. Who really wants to fill out the paperwork? If any paperwork is to be filled out I send it down to my lesser pirates to do it as they are my humble servants. They serve but do not govern.&lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>Me: So this means I should probably get a job that requires thinking?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>FSM: &lt;em&gt;Exactly my point young lad! I think you’ll grow up to be a fine young pastafarian! I think lyrics of this song should guide you,&lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>

      <Name>Pirates’ Effects on Global Warming</Name>
      <Chapters>
        <Chapter Number="1">
          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>Global Warming is indeed in agreement with the diminishing number of pirates</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>There have been some arguments, however, that this is not a scientific claim</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>However, His Noodliness may be simply not helping fix the damaging we caused by giving up our piratical practices</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>There may be a scientifically based reason for global warming</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>He may have set it as penance for us to redo the pirates’ global cooling</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Some actual scientific ways for this piratical cooling have been proposed, such as the stirring of waters by non-heat engine ships allowing absorption of heat from the atmosphere</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>However, people do not agree with this being testable or even plausible due to the sheer size of the earth</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>In addition, Thermal Physics is a class everyone fails and there is no effective model for treating the entire earth</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>It cannot even be considered a gas!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>However, simpler concepts we understand very well: Conservation of momentum, conservation of energy, et cetera</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>This can make an interesting thought experiment for us</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>We know the solar intensity that hits earth is roughly one kilowatt per square meter</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>This can add up to a lot of energy, but negligible momentum</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>Light is, after all, light</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>So this often manifests itself as either plant energy, or simply warming things up</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>Models of the Earth as a non-ideal blackbody, with an appropriate emissivity, account for this well</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>Many scientists have clamed that carbon has adjusted our emissivity, thus causing the sweet spot of blackbody output to solar intensity input to de-equalize</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>The more energy coming in means we are going to have to increase temperature to radiate it out</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>But we have not looked into other sources affecting this balance- Intensity increase</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>We know, perhaps, the sun is roughly stable</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>But what if the Earth is not?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>We may have an unstable orbit, pulling us in closer to the sun every day</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>Forces will kill us all, as this seems to agree with scientists’ notion that we will need to find new planets to colonize ere the sun swallows us</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>With a closer separation, Earth would present a surface able to catch more solar rays</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>While this may be exciting for cosmic ray and neutrino physicists, we must note that the more solar energy striking defines more intensity to the earth- and thus, a higher temperature</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>But how would pirates have caused the correction of this energy- conservation catastrophe?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>We must hearken to another fundamental physics concept- the conservation of momentum, as expressed under Sir Isaac Newton’s Third Law</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction force</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="29">
              <Text>What this can do is something to push us away from the sun, and counteract the slight gravitational imbalance</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="30">
              <Text>Now, let us consider how pirates are depicted- they may plunder shores at night, or ghost ships may sail in such dark hours, but we know pirates often sail in the day</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="31">
              <Text>After all, that is how they are seen in movies and video games</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>Furthermore, they are only depicted in the central Atlantic and Caribbean- one side of the earth, close to the middle</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>Now, here is an interesting notion: In the morning, the boats are tied up at the dock</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="34">
              <Text>The sky is of course, roughly, facing the sun</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="35">
              <Text>To leave and start the day, the boats are untied and let drop into the water</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="36">
              <Text>So the water pushes them up, and keeps them afloat</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="37">
              <Text>But wait!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="38">
              <Text>A reaction force is also taking place</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="39">
              <Text>The boat pushes the water down, sending it towards the bottom of the ocean</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="40">
              <Text>This means a slight pulse will hit the sea floor for each ship off to collect booty</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="41">
              <Text>This same push down on the water also will occur with cannons aimed up, and other seemingly trivial acts</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="42">
              <Text>However, these can all add up to a macroscopic push on the earth- still tiny relative to the Earth’s mass, but not so insignificant</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="43">
              <Text>Now, as shown by our knowledge of piratical history, these pushes will be on only one side of the earth, during the day</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="44">
              <Text>Since they shall be down, this will be away from the sun</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="45">
              <Text>So all in all, this slight push can be a slight counteraction to our instable orbit</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="46">
              <Text>It seems to have had a history of exactly cancelling out our planet’s falling into our sun</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="47">
              <Text>So, pirates would have kept us at this same orbit and kept the same solar intensity striking</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="48">
              <Text>But now, the radius slowly shrinking will continue the terrors of global warming and eventually end with the sun swallowing up the earth</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="49">
              <Text>We must exercise immediate action towards recreating these piratical practices, and save our planet</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="50">
              <Text>Besides, it will be fun for all!</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>Once upon a time in the holy land of New Jersey, a worried, young Pastafarian named Steve went to seek reassurance and solace from the leader of his congregation.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>“Captain Jeff, Captain Jeff!” he cried.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>“Every day I see more news that the scientists are finding more evidence for their theories.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>Theories that contradict our beliefs!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>I fear the Dark Lord Darwin is trying to tempt me with his reason.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>I fear his power in this world is growing and the Pastafarians are doomed.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>You must do something to stop him and his science!”</Text>

            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>Dude, you give me way too much credit,” said Captain Jeff. 9 “I may be a leader of a congregation, but I’m actually pretty incompetent.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>I’m not nearly powerful enough to smite Darwin, but don’t worry, our savior is coming.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>Soon the Pastafarian messiah will be sent by the Flying Spaghetti Monster to vanquish Darwin.”</Text>
            </Verse>

              <Text>“Seriously?” asked Steve.</Text>

              <Text>“You bet your ass, dude,” replied Captain Jeff.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>“Will he be the son of the FSM?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>“Maybe,” answered Captain Jeff, “He does get around.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>But he doesn’t really have to be the son of the FSM or even the FSM Himself in human form for him to be a good guy.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>“I see,” said Steve, “Can you tell me more?”</Text>

            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>“The messiah will come soon, probably sometime in the next few years. He will go by many names:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>Cheeses, our Commodore Cheeses, the Son of Manicotti, the Lamb Chops that were Eaten, Pasta of the FSM, and/or the Captain of Captains.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>He won’t look like what we’d expect.</Text>

            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>He will be sympathetic to the scientists, even though they are ruled by reason.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>He will prove that he is in fact the messiah, but he won’t perform miracles to do so.</Text>

              <Text>Miracles don’t prove much anyway.</Text>

              <Text>Instead, he will be more like the FSM than any other man.</Text>

              <Text>He’ll be an amazing prankster and will be pretty damn funny.</Text>

              <Text>He’ll drink a hell of a lot of beer and he’ll be a big fan of strippers.</Text>

              <Text>0 Not the level of organisational competence you would like to see from someone landscaping your garden, let alone creating your world. 11 The fifth “I’d really rather you didn’t” actually seems quite a sensible suggestion from such an absent-minded deity: “I’d Really Rather You Didn’t Challenge The Bigoted, Misogynist, Hateful Ideas Of Others On An Empty Stomach. Eat, Then Go After The B******s”. 12 Unfortunately in the western world, society no longer has to spend so much of its time on survival-related activities and consequently has more time available to devote to bigotry, misogyny and hate. 13 As a result, devout Pastafarians need to spend a lot of time filling their stomachs before tackling the injustices of the world. 14 This has led to a bit of a global obesity problem. 15 Deity fail. 16 On the face of it, my argument seems a bit bleak: who is this Idiot that created our world? 17 Why should we favour Him over some Judeo-Arabic-Christian deity who at least looks like us? 18 Well, think about it: He’s screwed up the environment He has to live in; He gets drunk and makes big mistakes, which he then has to sort out; He is made of carbohydrates and red meat which we eat too much of and get fat and unhealthy. 19 Truly, we are made in His image.</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>1 While it seemed another night, I found myself tossing and wearied. When Finally I did pass into slumber right away I was taken into dream. I dreamt a man stood at the end of the bed. In full pirate regalia, he was clad, buckle shoes, stripey socks, pantaloons, a wide belt, a loose poet’s shirt, and tricorn hat. From where I lay, it was quite clear that he had been drinking heavily, as the smell of beer was quite strong.1.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>“Come with me” he said. “Why?” I asked “Why should I go with you, obviously a drunkard, and a stranger as well?” “Do you not know me?” said he, and indeed, though I had never laid eyes upon this man before, I somehow knew him. “In my previous life, I was sometimes called Saint James the Bastard.” This name I knew though the man I did not. So I agreed at last to come with him. “Is it far?” I asked. “As far as a lifetime and only a single step away” he answered, and took me to the window.1.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>My window opened not onto the trees that normally, but instead upon a well-fitted brigatine. Several more pirates crewed the ship and snapped to attention as the captain and myself came aboard. “Cast off, me hearties! Set course for Heaven!” and the scurvy crew set about to sail the ship high above my town. We touched down in a pesto-dark sea, the morning sun stained the skies marinara red. And after many years that took but a eye-blink, a island hove into view.1.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>The island was immense. Big enough for all the people of the world who ever lived and were yet to come. As we approached, I could see the massive volcano that dominated the island. Even Olympus Mons on Mars would be dwarfed by the massive mountain. And on Heaven’s slopes gleamed rivulets of freshly erupted beer. Some collected into trickles which danced over the rocks. Others collected into mighty rivers, which filled lakes in which Pastafarians played. Even from this distance, I could see that some streams were dark with Porters or Stouts, and others were light with Pilsners and Kolsh, with a spectrum of brews flowing down the slopes, so that each may try what is their preference.1.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>And in between the streams, I could make out many buildings. Some looked to be massive factories, square and gray, others looked to be dwellings, tastefully made out of flotsam and wrecked ships. In some places, many, many buildings clustered together near a bend in the stream of beer. In other places, great swathes of the mountain were left open, so those who wished solitude could have it.1.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>From the many bays and piers I noticed many ships setting sail and coming into port. “Captain James, those ships, where do they go? From where do they come?” I asked. To which he replied “Those be the holy messengers, charged with bringing believers in. Often, they are sent to bring pasta to the Earth.” “Pasta comes from heaven?” I asked, startled. “Of course it does!” He replied. “What? Did you think it grew on trees?” Properly humbled I remained quiet, but Saint James was not finished yet. “By the way, you forgot to capitalize Heaven there. It be a proper place name, so be deservin of capitalization. You are a Pastafarian! We don’t let ourselves wallow in ignorance!” Properly chastised, I turned to the pier to which we were approaching.1.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>As the ship was tied off, the Captain took me down the gangplank. We were greeted by a great throng of people, those dressed as pirates, and those with little or no clothing at all. And as we walked upon Heaven’s holy shore, I could not help but notice that it seemed… less then Heavenly. While the strippers were pleasant to look upon, and I am sure had nice personalities, most were homely instead of fair. The pirates on the shore were fine people, yet not that interesting. Even the stream of beer, flowing down Heaven’s holy flank was flat and macrobrewed. The bowls of pasta which seemed to be upon nearly every rock, were undercooked and the sauce was watered down. “Captain? Why are these things here? Why are the shores of heaven filled with ugly strippers? Why are the Pastafarians such bores? The pasta is terrible and the beer worse. Why are these things in Heaven?” And Saint James gave me the First Truth.1.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>“Many of the living believe that there is a Heaven for those who are to be rewarded, and a Hell to punish. This is not His way. He gathers all the best and brightest to Him at the Crater. The coolest pirates. The hottest strippers. The sauces there would blast away your mortal mouth. And the beer? Sweet Spaghetti Monster…” Seeing that words had failed him, I turned to the volcano, and looking up saw the top was lost in Alfredo-white clouds. “It is a long walk.” I observed. “Not really. This be Heaven, after all.” he said. “Well, less so this part, which be the outskirts. As the Flying Spaghetti Monster gathers those most worthy to him, those deserving of heaven inhabit all parts, according to their virtues.” “And which virtues are these?” I asked. And Saint James gave me the Second Truth.1.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>“Any who believe” said St. James “Are saved. There is a spot in Heaven for them. While it is possible to a complete douche bag and still get into Heaven, you will not be invited to the parties, nor on the pillaging crews, nor to swim in the cauldron. Some get over it and knock off the crap. They slowly get accepted further up the mountain. Others accept their place and set about making it better. They quickly find themselves very busy far up the slopes. And others still can’t give it up. They find their place down here, and grumble about the beer, and complain about the ugly strippers, yet do nothing to improve their situation. They may spend eternity down here.” he explained. “Are they doomed? Will they never partake of the Holy Font of beers? Never taste the Perfect Alfredo? Never set eyes upon the Most Beautiful Strippers?” I asked shocked. “Don’t be an ass.” said St. James. “They can go wherever they want. This is Heaven, after all! But like in real life, people don’t like to hang out with chowder heads. And more and more, those who deserve find themselves accepted for who they are up the slopes, and those who remain without virtue, find themselves accepted farther down.” “Ugh.” Said I. “It sounds like high school.” “It is like high school,” replied St. James. “But unlike that flawed copy, in Heaven, you are actually valued by what you are worth, rather then by who you are dating or who is on the football team.” “So what are these virtues, then?” I asked. “Oh, sorry. I got sidetracked there.” Said St. James. And proceeded to give me the Second Truth for real this time.2.0 “Pastafarians are judged by a number of Virtues,” explained St. James “But the most important are Wit, Piratitude, Respect, and Comeliness. Wit is not just making up snarky comments, though those are important, especially when defending the faith. Instead, Wit is all things mental. Quickness of thought, reasoning, acuity, curiosity, personality, acceptance. Those that go out and explore His creation and enjoy it and wish to find out more about it are blessed. Those that retreat to only one book, or to the television, they are doomed. Those that do not ask questions, that do not marvel at everyday things, those who do not go off the recipe to try and make the sauce better… they may never see Heaven’s blessed shore. Those that hate or fear the many, many things that He created cannot be true Pastafarians.”2.1 “PIratitude is force of will. It takes will to show up dressed in holy regalia in these modern times. It takes will to stand up for what you believe in, and to draw cutlass to defend it. Piratitude might be said to be able to take what you want from life, despite what others want. Besides, doing something interesting that you want makes you a more interesting person anyway. There is a noted lack of accountants up here, you know.”2.2 “Respect might be the greatest of the Virtues. In some ways, it is the flip side of the coin of Piratitude. Where Piratitude says you should go ahead and build a pirate ship out of recycled beer cans, Respect says lay off those who ain’t attacking ye. Respect all of His creation, for He made it. Recycle, turn off the light when you aren’t in the room, and for Heaven’s sake, get rid of that retarded SUV! Respect people too, as they are part of His creation. It doesn’t matter who is climbing in whose bed, or what they are eating, or what they wear. They are following their own Piratitude just as you are following yours. So show some Respect!”2.3 “Comeliness is beauty. Not just physical, but beauty in any of it’s forms. Think of it this way, you want to make the world more pretty with you in it. There are lots of ways to do this. Start by not being a jerk. Take care of yourself and let others take care of themselves. Offer help to those who need it, not to those who don’t. We are all one crew on the Earth, what kind of crewmate are ye gonna be?”2.4 “These virtues all reinforce and supplement each other. Someone with a lot of Wit will have it easier to find a way to follow their Piratitude. By following their Piratitude, you will show others the way, and Respect their choices. Respecting others needs and wishes improves your Comliness. Finding ways to improve your Comliness will improve your Wit. It goes without saying that many times you can improve yourself in many ways with even the simplest decisions.” “Now you are making it sound like a video game.” I observed. “Again, a poor copy of reality.” quipped St. James, and lead the way up the mountain.3.0 We stopped in the shadow of a factory as we climbed Heaven. I refreshed myself with a quaff of &lt;em&gt;weissbeir&lt;/em&gt; trickling over a rock. It was notably better then those below. “Tell me,” I asked “I have always heard that Heaven has a stripper factory, yet we have passed a few on just our short trip. And I see more further up the slopes. Are the Gospels wrong?” “No,” he replied “Its like that place in the mall where you can make your own teddy bear. Even though there are hundreds around the world, you still call it a workshop singular, not workshops. Heaven has a stripper factory with many fabrication plants. It does not have multiple stripper factories.” I understood and followed him further up the slope past the wild garlic and basil.3.1 “Behold!” said St. James “The Great Beer Lake.” And I saw. Three streams of beer flowed into a natural basin, before pouring over the edge. And many pirates and strippers (and pirate-strippers. Rreow!) rested at its shore, sailed upon its waves, partook in its substance, or swam in it. We rested there at the shore for a while, and drank deep of the lake, and did admire the skinny-dipping of the strippers and pirates. And after a hearty meal of Pad Thai, we continued up the slope.3.2 From far off, I could hear the sound of flintlocks discharging. But St. James seemed to pay it no heed. In moments, we pulled into view of a massive pirate shanty built around a huge factory. “It must be a Friday” St. James noted as he entered into the town. And verily, all around the festivities were commencing. We saw a group of Pastafarians hauling casks of ale around. They made their job easier by drinking the casks as they went, making it lighter. Huge bowls of pasta were heaped for all to sample from. A pirate welcomed a freshly manufactured stripper from the factory. A group of Pastafarian ladies plundered the ale and pasta from their male counterparts in good fun. A great bevy of wonders I did see in that city, but St. James drew me on. “Come! We have to reach the Crater. You will have all eternity to explore Panpastum later. But there is more to show you now.”4.0 And true to his word, as we climbed, Heaven improved. The fragrance of great cooking was everywhere. The beer changed to the bitterest of IPAs, the richest of Porters, the sourest of Lambecs. Great clumps of tomatoes and garlic and basil seemed to grow everywhere. And the pasta! Ravioli exploding with flavor. Pot Stickers that satisfied with a single one, yet left you hungry for more. And I had a Cannolini that would make a grown man weep. The strippers we passed were humblingly beautiful, even the men. And the talk of the Pastafarians changed from whining about their situation to learned debates upon matters both classical and modern. I met with Jack Rackham, seated outside of a shanty, discussing the effects of Facebook on modern culture while drinking a very good American Strong Ale. Yet, even though the peak was in sight, St. James drew me onward to the top.4.1 And as we crested the top, I was allowed to witness the Holy of Holies. I cannot describe to you the glories there save for the fact that truly the most Witty, the most Piratical, the most Respectful, and the most Comely of the pastafarians and strippers were found there. They ate of pastas so good as to make heroin pale in comparison. They drank of freshly erupted beers so good as to make mortal brewmasters despair. And above it all, flew the Spaghetti Monster.4.2 I fell to my knees in the knowledge that I was not worthy of this view. Even the indescribable smell wafting from the crater was as far beyond what I deserved as I was beyond the sea far below us now. Then I felt his Noodly Appendage touch me. “There is no fate” He said unto me “Only what you make of yourself. If you truly wish this, then embrace your Virtues. There is a spot here for you, all you have to do is take it.”4.3 And I awoke in my own rooms, untouched as before. Yet I swear I could hear His voice saying as I woke up. “Oh! I almost forgot! Don’t forget to tell everyone, okay? Thanks!”</Text>

            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>His Noodlyness, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, lacked recognition, and so sought to spread His Word.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>Into the hands of wise men, he placed the seeds of knowledge that might sprout piety.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>His Noodlyness appeared to Grey, who He knew would provide a bridge between the realm of man, and the realm of pasta.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>In a dream, He spoke to Grey:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Grey, know that I am your Lord and Master, the FSM. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt;Know that through you, my Noodly Appendage is Manifest. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; In Manifest, thou wilt inform those whosoever thou shouldst see most fitting to rally My people. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Thou shalt inform him of the Holiness of Pirates, of my call for their return. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Thou shalt inform him of The Holy Meal, and its importance. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Thou shalt inform him of Bobby, and thou shalt guide him to Bobby. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Only then, will thy task be complete.&lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>And then, knowing and accepting his task, Grey awoke with a mighty, “YARR!”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>Yet untouched by his Noodly Appendage, fate would have it that placed in the path of Bach, was Grey, the scripture-bearing man of wisdom.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>More precisely, this scripture was the Word of Bobby.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>Bach read The Document and felt His touch.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>He was changed, no longer lost to the perplexing void of agnosticism, but now encompassed by His Infinate Noodlyness.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>Upon completeing the Document, a vision came over Bach: A strand of cooked spaghetti shot from Bach.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>It shot beyond the room in which he stood, beyond the earth’s atmosphere, beyond the stars and planets, beyond time and space itself. It was here that Bach saw his Noodly Master, who then spoke:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Bach! I had charged Grey with the task of informing you of My Word. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Through Grey I was made Manifest, and through that vessel, I reached out to you. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Grey’s task is complete, but for you, I have a task of great importance, a task which may prove lifelong… be you willing to accept? &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Wilt thou accept my noodly appendage to remain Manifest?&lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>For a moment, Bach was astonished, but he felt His touch, and knew it to be right.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>Confidently, Bach replied: “YAR! Whatever ye be chargin’ me with, Oi do mos’ humble accept!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>Yer Noodlyness hath scooped o’t me entails, boil’d ‘em, ‘n returned ‘em fortified w’starch.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>Oi be a bloody villain ‘fOi not be acceptin’ ‘o yer charge”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt;Good then, Bach! Thine decision pleases me, now shalt this single strand be fortified and twined to last for all time!&lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>Then, from beyond time and space came cascading noodles, twining and braiding as they came.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="29">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; I provide thou with an unseverable connection to my Noodly Appendage, now through you I am Manifest.&lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="30">
              <Text>Suddenly the vision came to an end, and Bach found himself sitting alone facing a black wall, he knew what course to take:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="31">
              <Text>Closely following Bach’s vision was the holiest day of the year: International Talk Like a Pirate Day.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>Bach decided to assemble regalia and wear it throughout this most holy day, regardless of the consequence.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>On the eve of International Talk Like a Pirate Day, Bach set out his Regalia, partook of the Holy Meal, and sought rest early.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="34">
              <Text>He awoke early to meditate on the tasks at hand.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="35">
              <Text>He was at first uneasy about his decision, but no sooner had he felt the first pang of uncertainty than all reality melted away to reveal the infinate noodliness that encompassed all.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="36">
              <Text>The FSM then spoke:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="37">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Be not afaid Bach, for no matter the outcome, thou wilt be executing my divine Word. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="38">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt;From’t no harm can be done, to’t no harm can be done. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="39">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Worry not, as all will be well, I am through you Manifest. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="40">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt;Be at peace, Bach.&lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="41">
              <Text>Bach ended his meditiation abruptly with a “YAR!” of confidence, then donned his Regalia and set off.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="42">
              <Text>Bach was at first unopposed and wore his regalia proudly, but, before long, was challenged by Bierul the Giant, master of the first eighth.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="43">
              <Text>“No ‘ats een d’buildeen, BACH!” cried Bierul.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="44">
              <Text>The bellowing voice shook Bach to his very foundation.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="45">
              <Text>He braced himself and found strength in His Noodlyness, at which time he responded: “yar, there be a clause in d’ no ‘at rule ye be brandishin’ ’round.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="46">
              <Text>Ye see, it be permitted fer ‘ats t’be donned fer religous reasonin…”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="47">
              <Text>But before Bach’s argument had been heard out, Bierul struck him down with his fearsome cane, “Yees’ot two choicees: firstly, yoo can t’k off d’at.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="48">
              <Text>Secondly, yoo can face Hale.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="49">
              <Text>Bach knew that he would most likely have to face Hale, master the eighths, and was about to meet Bierul’s threat head-on, when he felt a tug on his Appendage Manifestation and heard His voice:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="50">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Though thine intent fall on the boat, don’t be too eager to set sail. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="51">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; My word spreads, let it reverberate fore thy encounter with the master of the eighths. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="52">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Thine boat yet requires a hull, without which it will sink. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="53">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; When the time is right, thou wilt know. &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="54">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; When the time is right, act on it, but do not risk the peril of premature action.&lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="55">
              <Text>“So, wot’ll eet be,” demanded Bierul.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="56">
              <Text>“Oi be taken off me hat, Bierul, but in soul, it remain where it now lie,” responded Bach, as he scornfully removed his hat, and took seat amongst the subjects of the first eighth.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="57">
              <Text>And so Bach was persecuted, but at the begining of the second eighth, he readorned his hat anew.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="58">
              <Text>Meller, master of the second eighth, recieved his Noodly Appendage, and even had Bach speak His word to the class.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="59">
              <Text>The third and fourth eighths went by without notice, but as Bach traveled to the room of the fifth eighth a voice decreed “Eh! Captain Ahab!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="60">
              <Text>Teke off th’ hat!”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="61">
              <Text>The FSM sent along his twined appendage:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="62">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Now is the time, Bach! &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="63">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; Now! &lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="64">
              <Text>&lt;em&gt; With all that thy have, let thine faith pour from thy mouth like beer from our heavenly volcano!&lt;/em&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="65">
              <Text>“Teke off th’ hat, please,” commanded Nor.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="66">
              <Text>With a ferver, Bach replied, “Ay, that I shan’t be doin’.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="67">
              <Text>This be me Regalia, and I shan’t be takin’ it off.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="68">
              <Text>It be a divine decree that I should be wearin’ it.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="69">
              <Text>Shouldst I need to be speakin wit’ a man higher up ‘an yerself to rectify this problem, I be glad to comply.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="70">
              <Text>And so it happened that Bach was directed to Hale, the master of the eighths.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="71">
              <Text>Bach entered the master of the eighth’s chambers, and was met by a wench.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="72">
              <Text>“Wot’s ‘e matter?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="73">
              <Text>Wot you need’e see Hale fer,” inquired the wench.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="74">
              <Text>“Oi be needin’ to see the master of the eighth’s to rectify a conflict o’ faith an’ law,” replied Bach.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="75">
              <Text>He was then seated to wait, as Hale was busy with mastering the eighths.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="76">
              <Text>As he waited, for audience with Hale, Bach encountered Reldnarch, the pirate.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="77">
              <Text>Bach and Reldnarch exchanged piratey words, and then he departed.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="78">
              <Text>With his spirits bolstered by this encoutner, Bach was called back to see Hale.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="79">
              <Text>“What is all this about FSMism that I hear?” Asked Hale.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="80">
              <Text>“Oi, ye see, I was wearin’ me hat in celebration o’ th’ day, when I wos accosted boi a man who told me Oi couldn’t wear me hat!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="81">
              <Text>‘E said ‘at I should ‘ave a word wit’ you an’ that would be that and Oi could wear my ‘at!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="82">
              <Text>So, I come to yer and ask yer kindly ‘at you respect me rights and let me wear me hat,” Bach replied.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="83">
              <Text>Hale stared at Bach for a moment, unsure of what to say.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="84">
              <Text>Out of this moment of silence Bach’s confidence grew, and when Hale spoke, it almost did not matter what words he would speak, for nothing he could possibly say would sway Bach’s faith.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="85">
              <Text>“Well, you see: We only have one instance where an individual is allowed to wear a hat here, and he had a letter from a religious figure.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="86">
              <Text>If you can obtain such a letter, we might resume this conversation,” said Hale.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="87">
              <Text>With this ultimatum, Bach was barred from wearing his hat, however, he contacted His Holyness, Bobby, for a letter of the required specifications. Author’s Note: This is where my story ends for now, as Bobby has agreed to write me a letter, but has not yet done so. Also, this is a rough draft, subject to change. I hope you all enjoy it, I know that I enjoyed writing it. RAmen!</Text>

              <Text>It was a dark and stormy school day.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>My sister’s-fiance’s-son aka my nephew had a school assignment where he had to write a letter to the society of the future about his religion.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>My nephew, Tristan, a devout and proud Pastafarian decided he would write about us.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>His teacher, however, thought it was dumb and that he was just screwing around and took ten points off.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Tristan’s dad, Tall John, a Pastafarian-sympathizer, wrote a powerful letter back to the teacher explaining how FSMism is legit and saying she would never do the same thing if the paper was about Judaism or Scientology.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>The teacher, realizing that she was being discriminatory (and maybe noticing the irony that the letter is about religions intolerance), decided to change the grade.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>She gave him back five points, but kept the other five off for not proofreading, though there didn’t seem to be a problem with his spelling and grammar the first time she graded it.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>Now five points doesn’t seem like a huge deal, but it is the principle of the thing.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>Tristan took it like a man and was pretty proud of the incident.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>But persecution and inequality is a fate worse than dancing the hempen jig.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>Maybe some day we will be accepted.</Text>

      <Name>The Open Letter of Bobby to the Kansas School Board</Name>
      <Chapters>
        <Chapter Number="1">
          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>I am writing you with much concern after having read of your hearing to decide whether the alternative theory of Intelligent Design should be taught along with the theory of Evolution.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>I think we can all agree that it is important for students to hear multiple viewpoints so they can choose for themselves the theory that makes the most sense to them.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>I am concerned, however, that students will only hear one theory of Intelligent Design.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>Let us remember that there are multiple theories of Intelligent Design.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>I and many others around the world are of the strong belief that the universe was created by a Flying Spaghetti Monster.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>It was He who created all that we see and all that we feel.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>We feel strongly that the overwhelming scientific evidence pointing towards evolutionary processes is nothing but a coincidence, put in place by Him.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>It is for this reason that I’m writing you today, to formally request that this alternative theory be taught in your schools, along with the other two theories.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>In fact, I will go so far as to say, if you do not agree to do this, we will be forced to proceed with legal action.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>I’m sure you see where we are coming from.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>If the Intelligent Design theory is not based on faith, but instead another scientific theory, as is claimed, then you must also allow our theory to be taught, as it is also based on science, not on faith.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>Some find that hard to believe, so it may be helpful to tell you a little more about our beliefs.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>We have evidence that a Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>None of us, of course, were around to see it, but we have written accounts of it.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>We have several lengthy volumes explaining all details of His power.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>Also, you may be surprised to hear that there are over 10 million of us, and growing.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>We tend to be very secretive, as many people claim our beliefs are not substantiated by observable evidence.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>What these people don’t understand is that He built the world to make us think the earth is older than it really is.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>For example, a scientist may perform a carbon-dating process on an artifact.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>He finds that approximately 75% of the Carbon-14 has decayed by electron emission to Nitrogen-14, and infers that this artifact is approximately 10,000 years old, as the half-life of Carbon-14 appears to be 5,730 years.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>But what our scientist does not realize is that every time he makes a measurement, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is there changing the results with His Noodly Appendage.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>We have numerous texts that describe in detail how this can be possible and the reasons why He does this.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>He is of course invisible and can pass through normal matter with ease.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>I’m sure you now realize how important it is that your students are taught this alternate theory.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>It is absolutely imperative that they realize that observable evidence is at the discretion of a Flying Spaghetti Monster.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>Furthermore, it is disrespectful to teach our beliefs without wearing His chosen outfit, which of course is full pirate regalia.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>I cannot stress the importance of this enough, and unfortunately cannot describe in detail why this must be done as I fear this letter is already becoming too long.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>The concise explanation is that He becomes angry if we don’t.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="29">
              <Text>You may be interested to know that global warming, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of Pirates since the 1800s.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="30">
              <Text>For your interest, I have included a graph of the approximate number of pirates versus the average global temperature over the last 200 years.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="31">
              <Text>As you can see, there is a statistically significant inverse relationship between pirates and global temperature. &lt;a href="http://www.venganza.org/images/PiratesVsTemp.png"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter" title="Scientific Graph" src="http://www.venganza.org/images/PiratesVsTemp.png" alt="Technical Looking Graph" width="600" height="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>In conclusion, thank you for taking the time to hear our views and beliefs.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>I hope I was able to convey the importance of teaching this theory to your students.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="34">
              <Text>We will of course be able to train the teachers in this alternate theory.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="35">
              <Text>I am eagerly awaiting your response, and hope dearly that no legal action will need to be taken.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="36">
              <Text>I think we can all look forward to the time when these three theories are given equal time in our science classrooms across the country, and eventually the world; One third time for Intelligent Design, one third time for Flying Spaghetti Monsterism, and one third time for logical conjecture based on overwhelming observable evidence.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="37">
              <Text>Sincerely Yours,Bobby Henderson, concerned citizen.</Text>

              <Text>An ancient and venerable sage spoke unto the Pastaists of all the divisions, unto the Noodleists, and unto the Maranarists, the Fettucinians, the Pastafarians, and all of the great Pasta-based members of the Holy and Delicious Faith, and said:</Text>

            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>There will be a kind of HellLight, where unbelievers have to live with school cafeteria spaghetti, second rate beer, and boring jobs in the service industries where the Heavenbound FSMists will be living.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">

            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>Actual FSM Hell is reserved for a very few, and those will be divided from the Pasta, the finest beverages and the fellowship of persons of good will and kind intent.</Text>

              <Text>They will do all the laundry, cleaning and heavy or unpleasant jobs that are there.</Text>

              <Text>Never will they eat of the Pasta of any kind, but will live on lots of beans and rice, potatoes and extremely cheap cuts of meat, and the type of diet that the American urban poor can afford, or that Senior Citizens and disabled persons on Social Security are reduced to.</Text>

              <Text>There is a reservation there for the tricksters, the con-men, the Abramoff et al/Delay contingent, who will begin every work day by licking clean the footwear of every Native American person there, even in Hell Light.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>Also there will be the promulgators of the horrible practices against the indigenous people of every country ever “modernized” by Western Civilization.</Text>

            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>My humble apologies for my long absence from among you.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>I have been traveling with a group of Pirates on their ship the Trouser Snake.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>The Captain seems to occasionally fall into deep rum-induced revelries.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>This doth slow the boat’s travel no end, as you might imagine.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>It is tolerable, however,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>as he is a man of our faith and his revelries often produce tales both highly amusing and which seem inspired by Our Noodly Lord Himself, when I can parse them out.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>As you know, the Pirate requirement has not come easily to me.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>I suffer to this day with seasickness,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>and a formal education doesn’t exactly lend itself to the subtleties of the Pirate idiom.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>That, and every time I use “dem dere fancy-pants words”, I am threatened with being forced to walked the plank.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>I still struggle with the necessity to include occasional “Yarrrrr’s”, “Arrrrrrrrgh’s”, and “Yo ho ho’s” in my speech.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>I have more than once had a suspicious eye cast upon me,</Text>

              <Text>and a few “Ya best not be none a’them scurvy dogs o’ the port authority, or ye’ll be a’hangin’ from the mainmast like the Jolly Roger’s”.</Text>

            <Verse Number="14">

            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>Obviously, the True Believers shall enter directly, and as customers in no need of reservations.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>They shall be asked to recount their preferences, and thusly shall those preferences be fulfilled.</Text>

            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>I am relieved that I can see nothing in your letter which indicates that this is forgotten among you.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>It is most troubling to me, however, to see that there is argument among you that some sort of separate Hell,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>where those not of The Faith in Our Lord Glob may be thought to go upon their death.</Text>

            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>He may be most peevish toward the non-believer, t’is true, as the many accounts of His pranks do demonstrate.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>He condemneth not, however, any of His Creatures to eternal torment –</Text>
            </Verse>

              <Text>that is one of the many great sillinesses devised by other earthly religions!</Text>

            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>Well-meaning non-believers will arrive as wait-staff, with fair labor conditions,</Text>

            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>If they were inconsiderate, or broke the Flimsy Moral Standards by judging others and holding others in contempt for behavior which was none of their business, they will have to pay, and be limited in what they can enjoy.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>Especially nasty people will become the dishwashers and trash-collectors of Heaven.</Text>

              <Text>They will have no room for advancement for many millennia.</Text>

            <Verse Number="42">
              <Text>Lastly are those who did irreparable large-scale harm to the lives of others; they will be treated most harshly.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="43">
              <Text>The tyrants, the conquerors, the despots, the otherwise greedy and sickeningly unfair; all these will be made to bow down to those whom they harmed.</Text>

            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="45">
              <Text>Our Heavenly Glob instilled in them the same sense of right and wrong that He gave to others,</Text>

            <Verse Number="46">
              <Text>and these people willfully chose to ignore it.</Text>

              <Text>For them, unkindness in return awaits.</Text>

            <Verse Number="48">
              <Text>The Flying Spaghetti Monster who is Our Lord did not create us that we might simply then be condemned for failing to believe in Him.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="49">
              <Text>What kind of crazy scheme is that;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="50">
              <Text>to bestow his Creatures with life, then to throw that life he bestowed into eternal torment?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="51">
              <Text>That is the way of evil deities, not good ones.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="52">
              <Text>Our One Who Flies and is Saucy understands that life among beings with free will, on a planet with natural systems that cause tumult, and Scientifically Intelligently Designed by a deity who is prankish and can be peevish, should not end in eternal misery.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="53">
              <Text>That’s insane.</Text>

              <Text>Praise be to Our Lord Glob in Heaven,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>and a hearty yo-ho-ho unto you, my Brother and Sister Pastafarians.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>I am pleased to hear that my previous missive was well-received,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>and that the stonings have ceased.</Text>

            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Our Noodly One finds it reprehensible that violence be done in His Most Tasty Name.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>The ancient and wise prophets tell of many misinterpretations of the concept of punishment in His Noodliness’s World and the Hereafter of the Sacred Beer Volcano and Stripper Factory.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>This is not without cause; for our minds are small and His is Infinite. Yarrr, indeed.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>Let me mention again my familiarity with the writings of ancient prophets,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>for it is to these we must turn for answers to the complex questions you now ask.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>I do not doubt that misunderstanding of this abstraction was at the root of your squabble over the nature of the afterlife,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>and your confusion over how souls will be sorted.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>Argggghhhhh, this be one of the sticky points of Our Great Stringy and Orbed One’s Creation of All That There Is: the Flimsy Moral Standards.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>Arguments have ensued since the Great Creation of the Midgit/Midget as to what constitutes “Flimsy”,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>what constitutes “Moral”,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>and what constitutes “Standard(s)”.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>To further complicate the matter, the three words are solidified into a single phrase,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>with its own set of semantic confusion and argument.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>The errors and heresies of the past have been a result of eliminating or misinterpreting one of the words.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>You will remember, of course, the now extinct sect of the Moustaciolians.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>Their heresy was a dismissal of the word “Flimsy.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>They argued that the word was too abstract for an actual definition – too “flimsy,” if you will.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>They therefore disregarded it altogether, and simply went about enforcing what they regarded as “Moral Standards.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>This led them to become a warlike culture, hated by all their neighbors.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>They were so sexually repressed they refused to reproduce;</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>hence their current status as extinct.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>A similar fate befell the Ricearonians,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>whose heretical fallacy was to argue against any definable concept of Morals.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>No activity was forbidden.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="29">
              <Text>If another believer looked at you oddly,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="30">
              <Text>you could simply kill him.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="31">
              <Text>As you may imagine, this led to a shortage of converts, and an ever-shortening list of followers.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>The Ricearonians lasted about six months.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>The Couscousians have thankfully veered away from their disastrous heresy of refusing to imagine that Standards can be applied.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="34">
              <Text>They felt that the word “Flimsy” was irreconcilable with the word “Standard.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="35">
              <Text>Therefore, they simply had “Flimsy Morals.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="36">
              <Text>The Couscousians were well on their way to dying from preventable Sexually Transmitted Diseases.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="37">
              <Text>A few Letters and some cases of Penicillin have since put the Brothers and Sisters back on the road to True Believership.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="38">
              <Text>The Great Pastalogians and Pastapologists of the past have insisted that the three words be regarded in their entirety.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="39">
              <Text>They appear together without fail, in every ancient known source text.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="40">
              <Text>Granted, the overall concept can be easily misinterpreted, but you must bear in mind this:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="41">
              <Text>Flimsy Moral Standards are not the same as No Moral Standards.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="42">
              <Text>The Pastalogians of yore remind us that the concept of Flimsy Moral Standards must be interpreted as a whole with the “Not Commandments, Suggestions,” and various other ancient canonical texts.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="43">
              <Text>So, what is it you must know, my Pastafarian Brothers and Sisters?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="44">
              <Text>You must always keep in mind this:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="45">
              <Text>Whatever occurs between consenting adults and neither hurts nor involves anyone else is none of anyone else’s concern.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="46">

              <Text>&lt;/strong&gt;1 Aaahhhhrrrrr, a Pirate and Pastafarian by the will of His Noodliness the Flying Spaghetti Monster, to the buccaneers which are at sea, and to the faithful privateers in Pasta:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>Ahoy!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>Blessed be yer booty, and may yer coffers never empty. May ye all be fruitful (so as not to contract scurvy) and multiply (so as to be good at math).</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>Yer last missive greeted me in the same post as a letter I received from me brother, who lives in the City of the Red Stick, recently inundated by refugees from the great storm of Katrina. I hope this explains me tardiness in me response.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Tis heart-warming to this humble man of the sea to know yer daughter is doing well in college. Has yer wife received a new peg-leg from the good Doctor Davey Jones?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Ye asked me whether I would again tell the story of the great Volcano of Beer. While I am loth to speak of it, even when it is so far in me past, I will tell the tale again, with hope that you will spread the message of His Noodliness and how the Pastafarian heaven kicks the booty of the heavens of the false gods, and I mean not the usual definition of “booty”, mind ye.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>Here is the story then, as I be rememberin’ it.</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>‘Twas a dark and stormy night, to be sure. Me ship the Trouser Snake was rockin and knockin.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>First Mate One-Eye Johnson had taken the helm while I went back to me stateroom to ponder over a few of me treasure maps. I had me candles and lanterns lit, but most of the light was coming through me window from the storm’s lightning.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>I was ignorant of it at the time, but I suspect the lightning was actually the many and countless noodly appendages of our Creator, may His meatballs never whither.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>I be but a humble pirate, but truly I believe He was reaching down to me and me ship. I found out for certain when one of the blinding appendages reached straight through the hard wood of the Trouser Snake, into me stateroom, and struck me for dead.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>I was not the first pirate to be smote before his time, and I certainly won’t be the last, but from what I be hearin, I am the only one to live to tell the tale.</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>I awoke in a green field surrounded by strippers. The story of the creation of the Stripper Factory is not mine to tell, and I will dwell on it no longer here.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>Suffice it to say that The Trouser Snake and me First Mate One Eye Johnson seemed to stir within me. Perhaps I was not as far removed from them as it appeared.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>But I be digressin.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>I be a pirate, by His Grace and Sauce, and I like to be thinkin of meself as above fear. But I was certainly afeard of the strippers until one with a peg-leg approached me. She seemed familiar to me eyes, so when she beckoned to me with her hook, twas only a small effort to follow her.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>She led me to a small Italian bistro, which looked like it had sprouted out of the very ground. There were no roads leading to it, no sidewalk, no parking lot. But there was a sunny patio with small, two-seat tables with checkered tablecloths.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>The real kind of tablecloth, not that vinyl crap they have at Pizza Hut.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>We sat at one of the tables, and a silent but efficient waiter brought me a plate of the finest spaghetti it has ever been my pleasure to sample.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>Do ye know the bloated feeling ye get when ye’ve had too much spaghetti? Well I ate the whole plate of these heavenly noodles, scraped every morsel of meatball and tomato, and I was sated, but not in any physical discomfort.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>It was the most perfect meal I have ever eaten, and it was only then that I spoke. Mind ye, not a word had been said to this point between meself and the stripper.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>“Do ye have anything to drink that would match the perfection of what I just ate?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>And the stripper said, “If you are thirsty, you shall have what you desire in time. For all things come from His Noodliness, as they are ultimately returned unto Him.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>“I be not overly thirsty, madam. ‘Tis but a custom to have drink with meal. But first, I must ask, as ye speak of noodles: What have ye done to me Trouser Snake?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>And the stripper said, “The Trouser Snake holds firm. Your mainmast stands proud and erect, and the wood is as hard as ever. One-Eye Johnson stands full and tall at the helm, sad for the loss of his captain, but hard-set and ready to plunder booty.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>“The loss of his captain?” says I. “What has happened to me then?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>“You have been touched by His Noodly Appendage. Rejoice and be glad, for unto you is given a message to be proclaimed, and a task to be done.”</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>I measured not the time, for at the bistro it was always early evening.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>It may have been days that the stripper told me of Our Noodly Master and his benevolence, wisdom, and sauciness.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>In that time she told me all that I will someday tell you, that ye may be disciples in Pasta, that ye may spread the word, and that ye may pass the parmesan.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>Twas the Flying Spaghetti Monster that created our short friends, the midgits.</Text>

              <Text>But not necessarily in that order.</Text>

            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>There be more to it than that, but I’ll be coverin it in a later letter, perhaps.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>Though she told me much, and though I had not pencil nor paper with which to take notes, I remembered all that the stripper told unto me, including that she said “unto” a lot, so that I be usin it in me everyday speech to this day. To be continued…</Text>

              <Text>One day a man entered a strip joint and sat at a back table.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>Verily, he did order his minimum of drinks, which numbered two.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>He sat, expressionless, staring at the strippers, without tipping, without beckoning them over.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>And, yea, did the strippers avoid him and call him ‘creepy.’</Text>

              <Text>All night, the creepy patron did sit and stare.</Text>

            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>The strippers whispered amongst themselves about the body parts he most likely concealeth in a freezer.</Text>

              <Text>But, lo, one stripper did become intoxicated and became much too physical with all the customers.</Text>

            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>One day an elderly couple gathered their four children, two sons and two daughters, together for a serious discussion.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>When all were present they asked, ‘What are your views regarding the afterlife, religion, or spirituality in general?’</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>Now, it was known that the couple was in the process of drawing up their Last Will and Testament.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>Over the years, their wealth had grown to an envious amount.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>The children felt that their inheritance might be influenced by their responses.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>But they were strong, independent thinkers and they all knew that their parents respected honesty, so each child resolved to speak the truth, no matter what the consequences.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>The eldest son spoke up first: ‘Mother, Father, I have never hidden my feelings on this matter; I proudly consider myself an atheist.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>All observable evidence supports the idea of a universe capable of running itself without the benefit of a guiding or creative hand.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>And every god that I have ever heard of seems more likely to be wishful thinking, fable, or myth.</Text>

            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>When supportable evidence is presented that indicates otherwise, I will reconsider my position, but until then, I will look to science to answer all my questions and solve all my problems.’</Text>

            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>The oldest daughter responded next: ‘I respect my brother’s opinion but I cannot commit to such an inflexible attitude.</Text>

              <Text>I agree that no evidence can be shown to prove a god’s existence but no evidence can be shown proving a god’s non-existence, either.</Text>

              <Text>All eyes turned to the youngest daughter.</Text>

              <Text>She sighed, took a deep breath and drew herself up, as if expecting an attack.</Text>

            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>One day, the Great Pirate Solomon summoned his two sons and set them a challenge.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>‘I require 10, 000 cubits of pasta, brought from the farthest, most inaccessible port in China.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>Whosoever provideth the pasta first will be rewarded with one of my finest asses.’</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>Now, the Pirate Solomon was heralded far and wide as a breeder of amazing pack animals.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Each of his donkeys was worth its weight in gold and could carry enough dry pasta to feed an army.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>It was rumoured that twin donkeys had been born recently, however, that could carry ten times the weight of the next strongest animal and were so intelligent that training them took little effort.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>The two brothers rushed to the shipyard to set sail.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>The first son did a quick inspection of his ship and set forth almost immediately even though he had several leaks calling for attention.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>‘I dare not spend time and money on repairs,’ thought the pirate prince.</Text>

            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>‘A quick coating of pitch will do the job.’</Text>

            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>He launched with a raggedy crew comprised of as many loiterers from the docks as he could bribe with a promise of easy money and began to take on water almost instantly.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>He and his men bailed to no avail and had to return after only a few hours.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>Meanwhile, the other son was patching up his ship with superior materials while he waited for the men he had invited along on his expedition.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>When the eldest returned he was gladdened to see that his brother had not yet put out to sea.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>Reluctantly and hurriedly he managed to get his ship in adequate shape for his voyage pausing only to shanghai more men to man the oars just as his brother unfurled his sails.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>The bandit brothers sailed for weeks; first one would be in the lead, then the other.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>The eldest had rowers to supplement the wind, but many had to be put to work bailing water and mending the leaks that continued to appear due to his rushed and shoddy work.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>And his sails were in pitiful shape compared to the younger brother’s.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>In the end, the bedraggled boat pulled into the Chinese harbor only half a day ahead of the other.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>With as much haste as he could manage, the eldest pirate acquired the necessary pasta.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>He stole what he could but was forced to sell some of his men into slavery to purchase the rest (there had been talk of mutiny, in any case).</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>Tired, hungry, and running from Chinese guards, the eldest set out on his return trip just as his brother’s boat appeared over the horizon.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>He laughed to himself and tried to cheer up his crew: ‘Before long, men, I shall posses one of my father’s greatest treasures and you will be rewarded handsomely!’</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>While the first ship creeped its way homeward despite the best efforts of the first mate to drive the rowers to superhuman lengths, the second son docked and began negotiations with the Chinese Keepers of the Pasta.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>Many days later, a messenger ran up to the Great Pirate Solomon crying, ‘My lord, your son has returned!’</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>‘Escort him here so that I may reward him.’</Text>
            </Verse>

              <Text>‘And your other son, sire?</Text>

              <Text>His ship has been spotted also.’</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="29">
              <Text>‘Ah. Bring them both before me and my two prize animals, as well.’</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="30">
              <Text>And so it was that both sons of the infamous pirate Solomon were presented to their father; one dirty, unkempt, and wild-eyed, the other, calm, confident, and standing tall.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="31">
              <Text>‘Have you both brought the consecrated carbohydrates?’ asked their father.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>The sons stood aside so that he might view the mounds of spaghetti, tortellini, fettuccine, fusilli, and ziti that had been piled behind them.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>The stacks of foodstuffs were as different as the brothers.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="34">
              <Text>One was clean, neat, and easily over 10,000 cubits with such an aroma many in the room would have sworn it was fresh even knowing that it had been brought from China.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="35">
              <Text>The other was rotting, full of insects, and much less.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="36">
              <Text>‘Who was the first to arrive?’ asked the Great Pirate Solomon, giving a disgusted look as a rat ran out of the smaller pile.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="37">
              <Text>‘I was, father!’ cried the eldest.</Text>

              <Text>The first wench obsessed over every guest’s likes and dislikes, desperately trying to ensure that everyone had the most magnificent time possible.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>She spent more money than she could afford and was in a constant state of panic over how the party might go.</Text>

            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>Her significant other was forced to the local pub to seek the relative peace and quiet of the afternoon brawl.</Text>

              <Text>The band refused to play the medley of songs she requested and ended up getting drunk and hitting on her teenage nieces.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>She tried to compensate for the seeming lack of conversation between her guests by flitting from group to group pointing out their mutual hobbies and acquaintances, but inevitably ended up interrupting at least a few interesting discussions.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>In the end, everyone left well before midnight, which is the sure sign of an unsuccessful party.</Text>

            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>The hag, I mean mother-in-law, arrived early and left early, seemingly in good spirits, and the rest of the guests ordered pizza and brought out a radio to make the best of the rest of the night.</Text>

            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>The next day, the second wench felt bad that her friends had been forced to entertain themselves but was satisfied that at least she had impressed the one she had set out to.</Text>

              <Text>It seems that the old woman had immediately began criticizing everything the wench had done the moment she had walked out of her house.</Text>

            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>She complained about the food, the neighbours, the class of friends invited, the furniture, and the hostess’ outfit.</Text>

              <Text>The good grog ran out early, but they made do with what could be obtained from the neighbour’s still.</Text>

            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>As the third wench and her pirate said good-bye to the last guest, with the sun’s rays peaking over the horizon, she was content, knowing that the majority of her friends and family had had a good time, but more importantly, she and her pirate had enjoyed themselves the most.</Text>

              <Text>I convinced them to come back next week but, since I only spoke to them over the phone, I don’t know what they look like and they might come in incognito, so you have to be at the top of your game.’</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>Again, the first waiter replied, ‘Yes, boss,’ and rushed out, but the second remained.</Text>

            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>‘You don’t really think I can’t tell the difference between those dishes even if I am rushing around from table to table, do you?</Text>

              <Text>‘Oh, no,’ he groaned as he sprinted out.</Text>

            <Verse Number="30">
              <Text>When he burst out the ‘In’ door he saw his two evening waiters and a table full of guests covered in red wine and pesto.</Text>

              <Text>The first waiter was picking up silverware and plates while apologizing to the customers.</Text>

            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>The second was arguing with one of them, claiming that he was not at fault because someone seated at that table had spilled water, causing him to slip and fall.</Text>

            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>As the owner hurried to intervene, the waiter yelled, ‘I quit!’ and stalked out.</Text>

            <Verse Number="34">
              <Text>Much later, after closing, the first waiter went to speak to his employer.</Text>

              <Text>‘Rough day, huh, Boss?’</Text>

              <Text>‘No worries. My tips have gotten a lot better lately.</Text>

            <Verse Number="40">
              <Text>I’ve been paying more attention to my tables and learning the subtle differences and nuances of the dishes on our menu and the customers really notice and appreciate it.</Text>

      <Name>A Letter from ADoS to the Dying</Name>
      <Chapters>
        <Chapter Number="1">
          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>Ahoy, me fellow dyin’ followers of our Great Noodly Lord.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>I says “fellow” for to all appearances, it seems we must all go to drink from the Beer Volcano at some point in our lives, usually at the end.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>I counts meself as most likely included in this trend.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>This trend, on that note, is one that often causes concern for those who has not yet died for the final time in their lives.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>We may worry about what will happen after we dies, both on Earth an’ in the great beyond.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>I wish to address these concerns, as far as Pastafarians is concerned.</Text>
            </Verse>
          </Verses>
        </Chapter>
        <Chapter Number="2">
          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>0 An’ o’ course, a pirate may return to shore an’ live incognito till old age or disease strikes. 11 Such a pirate might then be buried in the ground. 12 Me point is that a life o’ piracy has no guarantees about the causes o’ death, an’ as such no guarantees about what shall be done with the bodies. 13 As piracy is the Noodly Lord’s ideal lifestyle for His followers, it would make sense that He would not place strict requirements on us about last rites. 14 Presumably a death during an act o’ piracy would be ideal, but it must be remembered that many traditional allies o’ pirates are not, in fact, pirates (for instance, wenches, barkeepers, shipwrights, even the royalty in some cases), an’ thus it also makes sense that even this is not required. 15 Me advice to ye, worried Pastafarians, is that ye should arrange for whatever pleases ye to happen to yer body when ye dies. 16 There be no guarantees that it will happen, but ultimately, it probably doesn’t matter.</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>The other concern I wish to address is that o’ the afterlife.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>What we know o’ the afterlife is almost as vague as the instructions for last rites.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>We are fairly sure that there be Firmament, a Beer Volcano, an’ a Stripper Factory, an’ we can assume there be pasta an’ great oceans to sail upon.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>We can also assume we might meet our Great Starchy Deity, sauce be upon Him.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Beyond this, we know very little o’ the afterlife, an’ as a result, there be much debate about what kind o’ beer is in the Volcano, whether there be male strippers for the females, whether there be any punitive system, an’ many other things.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>I posit that the nature o’ the afterlife has been left vague for similar reasons as for instructions for last rites.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>We know several things about the Flying Spaghetti Monster.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>The fact that He is very frequently drunk is the most cited trait, but He is also mostly benevolent, an’ He also enjoys manipulating data to hide the truth.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>It is therefore possible, or so I surmise, that He has not only taken into account the fact that one-size-fits-all Heavens do not, in fact, fit all, but that He also was able to create a Heaven that is pleasing to just about everyone (or at least everyone who isn’t a total asshole), an’ the only reason we cannot fathom it is due to His love o’ changing our observations with His Noodly Appendages!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>ARRGH!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>This is only a guess, o’ course, but it should be enough to hopefully discourage disparagin’ others simply because they disagrees with yer own ideas o’ what Heaven is.</Text>

              <Text>You can check us out at the Rutgers Student Life website and this isn’t a joke or spam or anything.</Text>

              <Text>I am the President of the Rutgers Pastafarians, which is the Rutgers Chapter of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Now I don’t know how you feel about the issue, but basically we’re opposed to the teaching of intelligent design in public school science classrooms.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>We’re not out to prove it wrong, just that it’s not science.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>One of our goals is to improve the relations between the science and religious communities, since they both have smart things to say, and they’d be more likely to listen to each other if they like each other.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>What we had planned on doing was to have a liaison, a member who shares both of our viewpoints and is in both of our organizations, who will serve as a link between the two and to fairly represent each organization to the other.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>He/she would also serve as a nice, visible symbol of our positive relationship.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>We’re also eager to collaborate on projects together.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>We already have developed friendly relationships with Campus Crusade for Christ and the Rutger University Pagan Student Association.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>In fact, our staff adviser is also the staff adviser to Trinity House.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>So let me know what you think, and if it’s cool with you, we can discuss this further in more detail.</Text>

            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>Thanks for contacting me– I apologize that I wasn’t able to respond to your message sooner– I was out of the country for two weeks.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>Your organization certainly has an interesting name– who created the “Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster?”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>It is certainly comical but also seems to mock religious organizations (let me know what your perception is).</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Hillel loves to connect to other groups on campus and work on joint events.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Hillel does not take a stand on intelligent design in relation to education, though for the most part Jews are happy to separate church and state and do not advocate for intelligent design to be taught in schools.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>Hillel is not a membership organization– all of our events are open– so I don’t know that we could have a set liaison, but we would certainly be willing to work with you on events that you’re interested in planning.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>(We would need to decide on a per-event basis whether to co-sponsor.)</Text>

            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>I hope this all makes sense– let me know how you’d like to continue the conversation.</Text>

            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>It seems to mock religion mainly due to the fact that our main focus is Intelligent Design, which stems from the Genesis.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>While we have no problem with religion, we do have a problem with pseudoscience, and in this case, the pseudoscience is religiously motivated.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>So religion kinda gets caught in the crossfire, but we mean no offense.</Text>

              <Text>It’s meant to be ridiculous just to show a scientific point, the idea being that there’s just as much scientific evidence for the FSM creating the life that there is for a Designer doing it, just to characterize the issue as not being a scientific one.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>So since we feel that ID is not falsifiable (part of why it’s not science), we’re not saying it’s wrong, only that it’s not science.</Text>

            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>Also, though the Church has no set dogma or rules, a great deal of Pastafarians, myself included, support the idea of religious tolerance.</Text>

              <Text>My chapter has also established a code of conduct which bans any attacks or insults directed towards any religion.</Text>

              <Text>I had heard Judaism was for the most part pro-separation of church and state, but I didn’t want to make any assumptions on the opinions of any of the religious groups on campus, so I decided to treat all equally and approach everyone.</Text>

            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>It’s cool if you can’t do the liaison thing like I described, but I still think it would be good if we had some kind of contact system worked out.</Text>

              <Text>The only joint event we’ve got going is an Evolution-ID debate/lecture that Campus Crusade for Christ has an interest in cosponsoring with us, but that’s really in the early stages of planning and we might end up not going through with it.</Text>

        <Chapter Number="1">
          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>While I realize Campus Crusade for Christ isn’t a Catholic group, Pope John Paul II was a respected and intelligent man who did a great deal not just for Christianity, but humanity as well.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>Here is one of the most important people in the Christian world professing the importance of cooperation between science and religion.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>While the two have debated and had conflict throughout our history, a friendship between them can, in fact, help both sides.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>Both have intelligent things to say and people are more likely to listen to friends than enemies.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>I have come to this conclusion and made it a goal of the Rutgers Pastafarians to improve the relations between the science and religious groups on campus.</Text>
            </Verse>
          </Verses>
        </Chapter>
        <Chapter Number="2">
          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (the members of which are referred to as Pastafarians) is dedicated to keeping Intelligent Design (ID) out of public school science classrooms.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>At this point in time, ID cannot be falsified, tested, or observed.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>These characteristics are fundamental to science and any idea that does not possess them is not science.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>Furthermore, ID is clearly based on religion and therefore it cannot be taught in public school due to the separation of church and state.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Due to its unfalsifiabilty, however, we can’t say ID is wrong, only that it’s not science.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Also, though the Church has no set dogma or rules, a great deal of Pastafarians, myself included, support the idea of religious tolerance.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>The Rutgers Pastafarians have also established a code of conduct which bans any attacks or insults directed towards any religion.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>It is a zero tolerance policy and any violators are expelled from the group.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>So we are not out to prove Christianity wrong and mock Christians or any religion in any way.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>Christianity and Intelligent Design are separate ideas.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>The Church of the FSM is a satire of the ID movement, namely their argument that one cannot disprove that an omnipotent designer created the universe and life and therefore it is a plausible idea.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>We counter and say you cannot disprove a Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe and life and therefore by the ID proponents’ logic, it’s a plausible idea as well.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>It’s meant to be as ridiculous as possible to demonstrate the flaw in this logic, plus a little humor goes a long way in any argument.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>Evolution is basically the formation of new organisms through the inheritance of changed genes over time.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>The origin of life is a completely different idea, and evolution does not, nor is it meant to, explain how life started.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>So while Creationism is more about origins, while evolution is an explanation of how organisms progress.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>Since one covers the beginning of life and the other covers the rest, you can see how they could fit together nicely without conflict.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Furthermore, Darwin never said ‘Evolution is the inheritance of change over time and God doesn’t exist.’</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>It’s not part of the theory.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>The Church of England just apologized to Darwin, saying they misunderstood him.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>The Vatican agrees that evolution could be used as a tool of God.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>I don’t see why the Almighty wouldn’t use such an effective process to do His work.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>So ultimately, evolution does not have to conflict with or oppose both God and the idea of the Creation.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>With that said, and the reader accepts that fact, I can now give evolution a brief rundown.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>In the interest of keeping this concise and unbiased, I’m mostly going to drop keywords that can be researched or answered by me if the reader is so inclined.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>I feel that if I provide all the information, it might be biased towards my side.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>As with any serious issue you should research both sides, using all sources available, and make up your mind for yourself.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>As I wrote above, evolution is basically the formation of new organisms through the inheritance of changed genes over time.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>Natural selection is just the process where the variation of one organisms’ offspring allows them to gain an advantage over others, thus allowing them to produce more offspring than their competitors and pass on their advantageous variation of their genes.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>It is not a random process as many would claim.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>While the mutations that occur are random, they are fed through the selection process and which “guides” them systematically to produce good results.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>Claims of evolution being wrong as some traits are irreducibly complex are no good.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>Just because you can’t imagine how something works doesn’t mean it can’t work.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>Just because one doesn’t see how an eye could evolve, doesn’t mean the evolution of the eye is impossible.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>Imagination varies from one person to another and is too subjective to be good measure of possibility.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>One key aspect of the Irreducible Complexity argument is the idea that each trait is not built from scratch every time they are evolved.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>Old structures are frequently repurposed in the evolutionary process.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>For example, legs used for walking evolved from fins used for swimming.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>So the eye could’ve evolved from simpler sight mechanisms, that would allow an organism to see, but with less parts being used.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>There are various analogues throughout the animal kingdom: light sensitive cells in jellyfish, eyespots in planarians, and infrared sensors in pit vipers.</Text>

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>I’ll end this with one final point, my view of science back when I was Christian.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>I didn’t abandon Christianity due to incompatibility with my scientific views.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>I was a devout Christian and a strong supporter of evolution, the Big Bang, plate tectonics, etc. (I left Christianity because of a difference of opinions between me and God, but that’s a story for another day.)</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>So this was my reconciled view of science and Christianity.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Since humans are inherently sinful, I felt that God in all his power and wisdom wouldn’t trust us to tell the masses what he wanted to say.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Therefore, while the Bible has some good information in it, it’s still a book written by men, not by God, and should not be accepted as word for word truth.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>To do so could lead to blasphemy and sin, as something in it could be wrong and therefore contradictory to what God did or what He expects of us.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>While this is more wishy-washy when it comes to ethics, problems do arise when it comes to the Bible’s version of science.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>It is indisputably dead wrong when it presents basic information about astronomy (1Chronicles 16:30, Psalm 93:1, Psalm 96:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>, Psalm 104:5, Ecclesiastes 1:5), mathematics (1 Kings 7:23, 2 Chronicles 4:2), and psychology/anatomy (Matthew 9:4). 10 So who’s to say that Genesis doesn’t make a few mistakes when it comes to the Creation?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>Science has provided the correct information in those other cases, maybe it can also provide us with the correct information about the creation of the universe and of life.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>This doesn’t mean Jesus’ teachings are invalidated, but the Bible does presents false information about the universe, about God’s creation.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>So if God wanted to give us accurate information, a message, proof of His work, would He use a book written and controlled by imperfect and sinful men?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>Or would he scatter the evidence around in nature, leaving clues across galaxies or deep in the bedrock, where it could never be tampered with?</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>In my opinion, it would be a lot harder to fake the fossil record than it would be for someone to accidently change a few words in the Bible.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>So in conclusion, you can be Christian and support science.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>Us Pastafarians are just trying to protect science with a little humor.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>Assuming God does exist, He gave us science for a reason.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>I’m not saying I’m right and you must agree.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>I’m saying try to be as unbiased as you can and look at the evidence science has provided.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>If God is real, science can only show you the full glory of His work.</Text>
            </Verse>

              <Text>The Flying Spaghetti Monster’s chosen people are pirates, and He made man in their image, but man has forsaken Him.</Text>

            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>Our Holy Graph shows us that as pirates have decreased in population over the years, killed by ninjas and other ne’er-do-wells, global temperatures have increased.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>Pirates are after all His chosen people and He’s a little pissed off.</Text>

            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>And if that wasn’t bad enough, I see more and more of my fellow students falling prey to the Dark Lord Darwin.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>He corrupts them with reason and evidence, tricking them into thinking the myth of evolution true and causing them to choose Science and Philosophy over our holy and delicious teachings.</Text>

            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>And while we don’t have a Hell in the usual sense, these poor souls surely won’t get to the best parts of Heaven, which has a beer volcano and stripper factories by the way.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>Let me present St. Jason’s description of the best part of heaven, so you know what you’re aiming for.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>“And true to his word, as we climbed, Heaven improved. The fragrance of great cooking was everywhere. The beer changed to the bitterest of IPAs, the richest of Porters, the sourest of Lambecs. Great clumps of tomatoes and garlic and basil seemed to grow everywhere. And the pasta! Ravioli exploding with flavor. Pot Stickers that satisfied with a single one, yet left you hungry for more. And I had a Cannolini that would make a grown man weep. The strippers we passed were humblingly beautiful, even the men. And as we crested the top, I was allowed to witness the Holy of Holies. I cannot describe to you the glories there save for the fact that truly the most Witty, the most Piratical, the most Respectful, and the most Comely of the pastafarians and strippers were found there. They ate of pastas so good as to make heroin pale in comparison. They drank of freshly erupted beers so good as to make mortal brewmasters despair. And above it all, flew the Spaghetti Monster.” Revelations of St. Jason 4:0-1.</Text>

            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>These are indeed dark times.</Text>

              <Text>But the scripture does provide us with comfort.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>For example, in the Tale of Dave and Kyodai, written back during the Ninja’s Purge of the Pirates.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>Dave, a young cabin boy, volunteers to fight the deadly ninja champion, Kyodai, who Dave’s crewmates were too fearful to fight.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>Now Kyodai had killed many pirates and was pretty bad ass, but Dave, who had never been in battle, was confident he could win.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>They approached each other to fight.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>“Dave said to the ninja, “You come against me with your fancy sword, but I come against you in the name of the FSM, the God of the pirates, whom you have defied. Today the FSM will hand you over to me, and I’ll strike you down and kick you in the nuts.” Dave and Kyodai 4:10-11.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>Dave, helped by the FSM, smited the powerful ninja with a single meatball.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>You can also find solace in Pastalm 23, “1 The Flying Spaghetti Monster is my chef; I shall not want. 2 He maketh me to sit down at full tables: he leadeth me beside the busy kitchens. 3 He restoreth my appetite: he leadeth me in the paths of excellent cuisine for his name’s sake. 4 Arr, though I walk through the kitchen of the empty cupboards, I will fear no hunger: for thou art with me; thy noodles and thy meatballs they comfort me. 5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my meal with sauce; my platter runneth over. 6 Surely flavor and deliciousness shall follow me all the minutes of my supper: and I will dwell in the dining room of the Flying Spaghetti Monster forever.” The message is clear; you can be saved simply by having blind faith.</Text>

              <Text>He offers suggestions and lists things he’d really rather us not do, but if we don’t listen, it’s no biggie.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>But He is a drunk, and He is kinda dumb, so there are accidental smitings now and then.</Text>

            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>But there are some he really looks after and helps them in their time of need.</Text>

            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>Verily, I tell you there is no need 2:1 The Flying Spaghetti Monster speaks through all religions, deities, and prophets, and all religions, deities, and prophets are conduits to the Flying Spaghetti Monster 2:2 To worship any deity, or indeed worship of any sort, even the vaguest, is to worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and when you worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster, you worship every other deity and religion, for there is no distinction 2:3 The Flying Spaghetti Monster isn’t any more the one true god than any other; he is simply our interpretation and incarnation of the divinity of the universe, or whatever you may call it 2:4 As the Flying Spaghetti Monster said through the Buddha, “Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>This is how we must navigate the pluralism that is the essence of Pastafarianism 3:1 The Flying Spaghetti Monster does not wish us to believe every word of every religion, as that would clearly be a problem and lead to much confusion and conflict 3:2 All you have to do is be open to finding truth anywhere 3:3 If you agree with it, believe it, no matter if it comes from the Bible, the Qur’an, The Buddha, Dave Barry, or any other source imaginable; these are all conduits of the Flying Spaghetti Monster 3:4 The principles of life, liberty, and freedom outlined in the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution are principles the Flying Spaghetti Monster chose to convey through men like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 3:5 The lessons of Mohandas Ghandi, Nelson Mandela, Voltaire, Plato and Socrates are all lessons of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>If you were to take everything ever said in a religious context, removed the parts that contradicted each other, and overlapped the commonalities, what you are left with is a single word</Text>

11:2 While pondering my studies and devouring a delicious helping of pasta, a mysterious presence over came me, and I fell into a deep sleep. 11:3 This is the account of the vision I received. 11:4 I was in the midst of a dark forest which covered the entire earth, with snake like trees standing tall, higher then any tree that any man can perceive. 11:5 They each had 4 heads and slithered gradually along gigantic puddles of blue mud. 11:6 I felt a gloomy feeling of hopelessness, as if all had been lost. 11:7 Then I saw smoke rising in the distance, and went forth to investigate the place of witch it cometh. 11:8 With each step I took, I became more and more saddened, as if something horrible was taking place. 11:9 The source of the smoke was visible. 11:10 It was a stinky old place to two pipes leading out the top and one door. 11:11 There was green slime oozing out the cracks of the walls, and I saw meat. 11:12 When I finally reached the placed and went in, I saw the image of a chef with 2 heads.11:13 I saw one of the heads was red, and one was green. 11:14 I trembled at the hideous site as the horrid creature spoke my name, “Sasumun.” 11:15 “What?” I said with terror in my voice, “What do you want with me?” 11:16 With the sound of a million screeching chalkboards he uttered, “Chef boyar de!” 11:17 Instantly I jumped back in horror. 11:18 There was something about what he was saying that gave me the creeps but I just couldn’t put my finger on it. 11:19 Suddenly, I saw the every nation and every tribe in the 3rd person. 11:20 The beast was oppressing the whole world, forcing them to eat this horrible meat enclosed in a grain envelope. 11:21 I fell to the ground and cried out, “O, noodly one, stop this, stop this, the world doesn’t deserve this.” 11:22 I lay there on the ground suffering for what felt like years. 11:23 All I saw was the decay of good health by this hideous thing. 11:24 The odor of just one of his hairs caused a global wide technological melt down, and thus he had control over the whole world. 11:25 For you see, he came to the rescue in a global crisis, promising peace and good health, but he gave them just the opposite. 11:26 And he inserted a chip in every man’s forehead, and in every woman’s wrist that forced them to eat the crap that he prepared them. 11:27 Many nights past me by, as all of mankind suffered. 11:28 Then finally, something happened. 11:29 In the split of a second, in the instant of an eye, the food of the evil one poisoned him and he perished. 11:30 Then I saw the bark of every tree in every forest peal, revealing a new layer of bark that was fresh with the sweet smell of steam and tomato sauce. 11:31 And I saw noodles of spaghetti spout from the braches of the trees. 11:32 And behold every tree was fruitful with meatballs and spaghetti, standing tall as an intertwined marvel of spaghetti delight.</Text>

But Blackbeard said unto the Monster; “why do the unbelievers not board boats as well?” 12:21 And the Monster said; “it is My will that they should not, so do not ask such foolish questions.” 12:22 But Blackbeard said unto the monster; “why shall the ferocious lions and other beasts not attack me when I attempt to bring them to my ship?” 12:23 And the Monster said; “it is My will that they should not, so do not ask such foolish questions.” 12:24 And Blackbeard asked many foolish questions of the Monster, until the Monster grew angry. 12:25 The Monster cried; “enough! for it is My will that this should happen, and I shall enforce My will with My Noodly Appendage.” 12:26 And Blackbeard was quiet, and his crew loaded the plants and animals onto his ship. 12:27 But lo; for the flood waters were rising, and Blackbeard finished loading his ship just as the waters began to destroy the rest of mankind. 12:28 And they did not use their numerous boats to escape the flood’s wrath, and perished. 12:29 And they did not gather on top of high mountains, and perished. 12:30 And the flood lasted for many days, and it carved into the land many geologic features that seemed as if they could only have been created over many millions of years. 12:31 And the plants and animals and crew of Blackbeard’s ship did not die for lack of food or fresh water; for the Monster provided all. 12:32 And finally after many days, the Monster saw that all Earth was dead except the plants, beasts, and people on Blackbeard’s ship, and turned on the Stove of Heaven. 12:33 The waters receded, and the Earth was pure once again. 12:34 And Blackbeard’s ship landed atop a high mountain, as the waters continued to recede. 12:35 And Blackbeard said unto the Monster; “how shall the many continents and islands of the Earth, surrounded by the sea, be repopulated if all life is now here at this mountain?” 12:36. And the Monster said; “it is My will that they should; do not ask such foolish questions.” 12:37 And Blackbeard said unto the Monster; “why should the ferocious beasts such as lions and tigers not kill and eat the more frail animals now and cause them to be gone for all time?” 12:38 And the Monster said; “it is My will that they should not; do not ask such foolish questions.” 12:39. The Monster again silenced Blackbeard, and he again submitted to His will. 12:40 And the Monster said unto Blackbeard; “go forth and populate the lands, that the Noodly feast may be enjoyed for all time.” 12:41. And the Monster said; “lo; such a great flood shall never again destroy the Earth, and my Stove of Heaven shall for 5 billion years burn and keep the holy boiling water in the sky.” 12: 42 And the people of Blackbeard spread across the Earth, and worshiped the Monster, and were content. 12:43 But lo; for the people began to eat of the spicy foods as did the blasphemers of old, and witness delusions of other deities as did the blasphemers of old, and lose faith in the One True Monster. 12:44 But lo; for the Monster did not destroy Earth as He had before, for He realized in His wisdom that blasphemers would always exist as long as free will existed. 12:45 And so the Monster came to a compromise between free will and the punishment of blasphemers.</Text>

              <Text>And the Monster blessed the Pirates, that the Stove of Heaven should never scorch the Earth as long as the Pirates roamed the Seas, and the people of Earth were content.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;13 5m4r7_m4y8e_g3n1u5&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;The Revelation of St. Oregano&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13:1&lt;/strong&gt; “And there was a young pirate who did’st scrub his Captain’s deck loyally who received unto him a vision”&lt;strong&gt;13:2&lt;/strong&gt; “from upon high that spake unto him, saying, ‘Thou hast been chosen to receive the Sauciful word of the Almighty Noodle.’”&lt;strong&gt;13:2 1/2&lt;/strong&gt; “And young Oregano did’st inquire, ‘What the fu-’”&lt;strong&gt;13:2 2/2&lt;/strong&gt; “But the great voice did’st quell his fear saying, ‘Fear not, matey. For I am the Almighty Noodle, creator of beer volcanos and stripper factories. Surely ye know I care for thee?’”&lt;strong&gt;13:3&lt;/strong&gt; “And young Oregano did’st retort, ‘But if ye cared for me, thou would’st with thy Almighty Noodley Appendage smite the fundamentalists from Westboro!’”&lt;strong&gt;13:4&lt;/strong&gt; “‘Young Oregano, surely even you must see that those who deny my Noodley existence will one day not drinkst from”&lt;strong&gt;13:5&lt;/strong&gt; “Beer Volcanoes and partake of Stripper Factories? Surely you see that those whom hate and hate a thousandfold”&lt;strong&gt;13:6&lt;/strong&gt; “must forever read textbooks of science and math?’ spoke the mighty voice of the Eternal Spaghetti.”&lt;strong&gt;13:7&lt;/strong&gt; “‘Science, o Great Noodle? But I thought thou did’st change scientific data with thy Noodley Appendage?’”&lt;strong&gt;13:8&lt;/strong&gt; “And the Almighty Noodle replied saying, ‘Arrgh, thou speak’st true! But surely thou doth see that what they protesteth much against and cannot comprehend, they will be doomed to forever learn?’”&lt;strong&gt;13:9&lt;/strong&gt; “And young Oregano was awestruck. ‘Thy Noodley Justice is awesome and powerful!’”&lt;strong&gt;13:10&lt;/strong&gt; “And the Almighy Noodle did’st reveal, ‘I shall reveal to you now what no pirate or wench has heard.’”&lt;strong&gt;13:11&lt;/strong&gt; “Eagerly, young Oregano awaited.”&lt;strong&gt;13:12&lt;/strong&gt; “And the powerful voice from on high spake, saying, ‘In the Year of Our Noodle 1988, I will send to you a prophet who speaks true. He will hail from the Castle Arrrrrggghhhhhhh and he will speak truth to all the world. His name will be”&lt;strong&gt;13:13&lt;/strong&gt; “Stephen, the Hawking. He will descend from the sky on a cloud in a throne with wheels and he will love and be loved by all, except those from Westboro. And his visions of holes of black will be the truth.’”&lt;strong&gt;13:14&lt;/strong&gt; “‘The truth?’ Young Oregano was eager to know.”&lt;strong&gt;13:15&lt;/strong&gt; “‘Yea, verily, it will be the truth! Except for one minor detail.’”&lt;strong&gt;13:16&lt;/strong&gt; “Oregano was struck with great confusion. ‘And thou Almighty Noodle, what will’st that minor detail surely be?’”&lt;strong&gt;13:17&lt;/strong&gt; “And the Great Noodle did’st reveal, ‘The Prophet Hawking will proclaim with saucy appeal of holes of black that contain infinite gravity and density, but the noodley truth is that these are not holes of black.’”&lt;strong&gt;13:18&lt;/strong&gt; “Young Oregano, blinded and blessed with awesome Noodley knowledge did’st ask, ‘What will these holes of black surely be?’”&lt;strong&gt;13:19&lt;/strong&gt; “And the Almighty Noodle, creator of beer volcanoes and stripper factories spake unto Oregano the truth, saying,”&lt;strong&gt;13:20&lt;/strong&gt; “‘They will surely be my powerful Meatballs!’” &lt;strong&gt;14 Platypus Enthusiast&lt;/strong&gt; Author’s Note: So last night I received an awesome revelation in my alphabet soup. I transcribed the messages I received from three bowls worth. While I cannot decipher the divine tongue that it is written in, I have decided it deals with the Apocalypse due to the the few English words the FSM must have slipped in for my benefit. In Chapter 1, verse 3 “THE”, in Chapter 2, verse 7 “END”, and in Chapter 3, verse 5 “BYE”.

          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>And lo, the smug and self-satisfied idolators of Europe came forth from their shrines to Newton, Einstein, and Darwin; and did set upon the Mount of Toblerones a huge ringpiece, saying unto each other “Yea, verily this is a bigger ringpiece than even the ringpiece of the American idolators at FermiLab” And they called the enormous ringpiece “The Large Hadron Collider”, which is a silly name</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>And the men of the Tabloids did wail and rend their vestment, crying “Lo, it is the end of the World, these idolators shall bring ruin upon the face of the Earth by unleashing unknown forces upon the Firmament”; and they did send word forth that the idolators should henceforth be known as Boffins, and should be ridiculed in our sight</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>But the Boffins on Mount Toblerone cared not for the men of the Tabloids; and laughed and scorned them, saying “These men of the Tabloids know not whereof they speak, for truly they are obsessed only with Jennifer of Aniston, and Bradgelina of the house of Hollywood” And the friendship between the Boffins and the men of the Tabloids was cast asunder</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>And so it came to pass that the Boffins did gather to worship their own cleverness upon Mount Toblerone, and they did gather upon a Wednesday; and on that Wednesday the Boffins did take all the electricity from all the surrounding banks, watchmakers and chocolate factories to tithe their own cleverness through the enormous ringpiece; and the chocolate makers, bankers and watchmakers were vexed and wroth</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>And so it came to pass that the chocolate makers, bankers and watchmakers did cry unto the Flying Spaghetti Monster “Oh Flying Spaghetti Monster! We are vexed and wroth, for we have no electricity to boil water for our pasta! Forgive our apostasy, for it is due to the Boffins on Mount Toblerone! Deliver us from our torment! RAmen”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>And so the Flying Spaghetti Monster came unto Mount Toblerone to see what all the fuss was, and He looked upon the ringpiece and He saw that it was bad; so He manipulated the electromagnets of the Large Hadron Collider with His noodly appendage so that they broke asunder, and thus ended Wednesday</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>And early upon the Thursday, the Boffins on Mount Toblerone did gnash their teeth and summon their lawyers, for being silly empiricists they did not sense the touch of His noodly appendage; and they did summon the makers of electromagnets and did say unto them “Fix these damn things, or someone is going to get their ass verily sued”, and the makers of electromagnets were full of woe</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>So the makers of electromagnets did toil all day in the hot sun, under the stewardship of the many lawyers and their threats of litigation; and the Flying Spaghetti Monster did look down upon them with pity, and He decided that no more would He break asunder their electromagnets 10 So it came to pass that the Flying Spaghetti Monster did cause much confusion in the computers of the Large Hadron Collider, saying that Linux shall not speak unto Microsoft, and that remote peers would reset their connections; and He did manipulate ping response times with His noodly appendage, and the Network Geeks on Mount Toblerone did pray to the false prophet Gates for guidance 11 And the lawyers fell upon the Network Geeks like wolves upon the fold, saying “Thou shalt honour thy employer, and fear the wrath of his lawyers”; and the lawyers did devour the budgets of the Network Geeks, saying “We have a responsibility, no a duty, to spend all of thy research budget on legal fees, whether thou likest it or not”, and thus ended the Thursday 12 And on the evening of the Thursday, the Flying Spaghetti Monster did look down upon what He had wrought, and He was that it was good; and the next day being Friday, a holy day upon which none should work, He did drink deeply of the Beer Volcano, and did pay his respects at the Stripper Factory 13 But on the morning of the Friday the lawyers arose early, for they sleepest not and hang upside-down from the branches of the willow like bats; and they did say unto the Network Geeks “Wake! For the Sun who scatter’d into flight; shall set upon thee getting sued tonight!”, and the Network Geeks were full of woe 14 And the Network Geeks did toil all that holy day, and they drank not of beer, and they ate not of pasta; and they were vexed by the ping responses and IP routing which worked perfectly upon the Friday, for the Flying Spaghetti Monster was not manipulating them with His noodly appendage 15 And so it came to pass that on the afternoon of the Friday the huge ringpiece was operational, and the Boffins did give thanks, and the lawyers did give invoices; and the Network Geeks and makers of electromagnets did pack up their tents in the night and flee from the lawyers, saying “Let my people go” 16 Once again did the Boffins worhip at the enormous ringpiece, and did take all the electricity from the bankers, watchmakers and chocolate makers, and once again they were vexed and wroth; and they did cry unto the Flying Spaghetti Monster “Oh FSM! Why hast thou forsaken us?”, but He had forsaken them because He was still sleeping it off 17 And the Boffins did bask in their own smugness, and did cry out “Oh! What an enormous ringpiece we have wrought”; and they did turn up the power even higher and did become even more smug, and the bankers, watchmakers and chocolate makers did become even more vexed and even more wroth 18 But the pride of the Boffins was to become their undoing, for upon one of the electromagnets were seven ‘O’ ring seals, and the seven seals were integrity-checked by computer telemetry; and the Network Geeks and makers of electromagnets, who had fled before the wrath of the lawyers, had not properly repaired them, they being vexed, wroth, and full of woe 19 And behold! The electromagent shook, and the first seal was opened with a noise like thunder, and from it like a horse sprang white steam; and the computer telemetry system said “Come and see”, but the Boffins heard it not, lost as they were in their smugness 20 And the second seal was opened, and from it like a horse sprang red flames, which had the power to kill like a mighty sword; and the backup systems said “Come and see” but the Boffins paid it no heed, saying unto each other “Get me my agent!” and “Who is doing breakfast television?” 21 And the third seal was opened, and from it poured black smoke which ruined the wheat and the barley, as well as the olives for making oil and the grapes for making wine; and the junior technicians in the control room did say “Come and see” for they liked not the look of the telemetry, but the Boffins did say “Back off, man – we’re celebrating!” 22 And the fourth seal was opened, and from it poured forth noxious pale gases which caused death, and they covered the fourth part of the Earth; and the senior technicians who ran the control room said “Come and see”, and the Boffins did say “Huh? What the shit?”, and they did cease from their celebrating 23 And when the fifth seal was opened, the people in the control room did freak out, saying unto each other “How long, you dipstick? How long has this been going on?”; and they did take on raiments of white HazMat suits, and they did judge each other, each saying unto the other that it was the other’s fault and that they should be killed 24 And when the sixth seal was opened, there came a great earthquake, and the ground was rent asunder, the sky turned black and the moon became red as a tomato; and the stars of heaven fell to Earth, which really pissed off the Boffins no end, and the sky departed like a roller blind with a dodgy spring, and the people of Earth did hide themselves from all the weirdness 25 And lo, from the Earth did spring great electric clouds of luminiferous ether, and steaming pools of phlogiston, and the dinosaur bones that had been buried in the Earth to conceal its age did reveal their ‘Made In Taiwan’ markings; and the enormous ringpiece of the Boffins was consumed by the pit 26 And when the seventh seal finally gave way, there was silence in the heavens and on Mount Toblerone for about half an hour; and then people started calling the Boffins rude names, saying unto them “How much did it cost again?”, and “I wonder who’s getting sued this time?”, and the men of the Tabloids did cry “I told you so!” 27 And the shouting of the people sounded as the sound of seven trumpets, and the sound roused the Flying Spaghetti Monster from his slumbers, for He likes some big band music once in a while; and when He saw what the Boffins had wrought He was wroth, and as He had a hangover He was doubly wroth and somewhat vexed and full of woe 28 And the Flying Spaghetti Monster did speak unto the people, saying “What have you wrought here?”, and the bankers, watchmakers and chocolate makers did say “It was the Boffins! Blame them!”; but the Boffins did say “No! It was the makers of electromagnets and the Network Geeks! Blame them” 29 And the makers of electromagnets and the Network Geeks did say “No! It was the lawyers! They are always to blame”; and the lawyers did serve writs upon the makers of electromagnets and Network Geeks, and did order them to cease and desist their activities 30 And the Flying Spaghetti Monster did say unto the lawyers “Well? What dost thou have to say about it?”, and the lawyers did say unto Him “You’d better watch your mouth if you don’t want to end up in court, buddy”; and the Flying Spaghetti Monster was even more wroth and even more vexed and full of woe than He had been before 31 And the Flying Spaghetti Monster did cause the Firmament to come crashing down from Heaven, and the Firmament did sink the land beneath the waves; but the noise did cause the Flying Spaghetti Monster to wince in His delicate state, so He caused a great peace to fall across the Firmament, and he did retire for another quick nap 32 And so it came to pass that the Flying Spaghetti Monster took the rest of the weekend off, and on the Monday He did create another midgit; and He spake unto the midgit saying “Thou shalt remember that Friday is a holy day, when thou shalt get up to no mischief, for thou really doesn’t want to be on the receiving end of my divine retribution when I have a holy hangover” RAmen</Text>
