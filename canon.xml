          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>In the days when the Flying Spaghetti Monster combed the Bobby Mountain,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>He looked upon the Earth and saw that the land was devoid of chosen subjects.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>In His awesome Noodly Hugeness, the FSM cast his Noodly Appendage forth over the Bobby Mountain and said with a noodly growl,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>″Send forth my beloved subjects!</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Be they small and capable of head butting tall people in the groin.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Let them be capable of acting as mobile beer holders.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>Let them be cute and cuddly,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>and let them be capable of riding many a good winner at the races’. ”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>And into the world the Midgets did come.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>For they were indeed extremely cute and cuddly.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>The bald midgets were sometimes confused by the FSM with sticks of roll on deodorant.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>This amused the FSM greatly,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>who named the bald midgets ‘The Rexona’ or ‘ The Rexonii’ (plural).</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>But extremely cute and cuddly they were.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>In the early days the midgets grew much Basil and Herbs.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>And in the absence of protein in the diet, they did not grow tall.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>And the leader of their tribe was Egbert.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>For he was so loved by the FSM for his baldness, that he was spared from further midget gags as an act of charity.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>Then one day following the Basil harvest, Egbert and the tribe grew restless</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>and longed for the addition of minced beef in their pasta penne.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>But Egbert knew additional protein may force him to grow tall, thereby forfeiting his venerable midgetness.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>This would also forfeit his right to receive kid’s portion meals at McDonalds,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>which was a real bummer.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>And the FSM did appear unto Egbert and the midget tribe and spoke.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>″Look guys, I’m really sorry for the really bad midget gags at your expense.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>But it’s really boring being a supreme being sometimes.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>And the midgets did cheer sending forth high fives all round with their pudgy hands and fingers.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>″As a sign of my good measure I will allow you to add ground beef,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="29">
              <Text>provided you maintain a balanced diet and don’t grow tall.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="30">
              <Text>And the midgets did but whoop and holler in their tiny little voices</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="31">
              <Text>singing Randy Newman songs in his honour (you can guess which).</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>″Praised be unto His Noodly Appendages” they cried with their helium-filled voices.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>And in a bid to overcome their protein deficiency,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="34">
              <Text>the midgets set forth to slaughter everything that moved on the face of the earth.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="35">
              <Text>For they did slaughter the armadillo, the antelope, the aardvaak and all other animals between the letters A-Z.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="36">
              <Text>And Egbert did thus say: “Doode-a, keelling ell thuse-a creetoores soore-a beets zee hell oooot ooff grooeeng beseel und herbs.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="37">
              <Text>And there was great noodly happiness on the slopes of Bobby Mountain.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="38">
              <Text>For theirs was the Kingdom of Protein!!</Text>
            </Verse>
          </Verses>
        </Chapter>
        <Chapter Number="2">
          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>Following the great Midget reconciliation, the FSM did but enter a great period of self satisfaction.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>For his subjects were omnivorous and yet retained their venerable Midgetness.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>And in the great void feeling pretty damn pleased with himself, he put his many tentacles upon his great celestial recliner rocker and mellowed right out.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>But following many years of relaxation, the Great Noodly One did become very bored.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>Despite the presence of his beloved Midgets he was very much alone.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>Being the only supreme being, there was little or no chance of him meeting an FSM babe for a bit of red hot action.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>And absolutely no chance of him hoisting the if the Universe is rockin’, don’t come a knockin’ sign on his celestial door.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>And in his solitude, the FSM did begin the Great Boredom Incantation,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>that boomed across the sky and shook the little folk from their midget high chairs.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>I’m bored</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>I’m really bored</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>I’m really really bored</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>I’m really really, really bored</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>(you’ll get the hang of it after about 100 reallys)</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>I’m so bored I find watching Bold and The Beautiful an absolute blast</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>I’m so bored I find watching Oprah the highlight of my day</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>I’m so bored I find Bill O’Reilly almost comical</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>I’m so bored I find ‘Alexander’ an absolute ripper of a film</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>Then following the citing of several more thousand bad moments in TV and cinema, the FSM did thus end The Great Boredom Incantation.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>Sad for their Master, Egbert ordered the Midgets to try really damned hard to cheer FSM up.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>They dressed up in cute little outfits – Ewoks, Munchkins and assorted furry animals.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>They even sung cute little pantomine songs from Snow White, but the FSM was unmoved.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>Egbert in his adoration for the FSM raised his pudgy little arms to the sky and screamed:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>“Hey Greet Speghettee Doode-a. Vhy ere-a yuoo su sed? Bork Bork Bork!”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="25">
              <Text>The FSM replied in perfect Ivy League Midgetese:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="26">
              <Text>“Egbert, the midgets are my most blessed subjects.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="27">
              <Text>You have brought me great piles of basil and herbs.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="28">
              <Text>You have let me dish out many bad midget jokes at your expense.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="29">
              <Text>For you have remained my most venerable subjects,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="30">
              <Text>despite the culling many endangered species to eat with your penne pasta.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="31">
              <Text>And Egbert did reply:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="32">
              <Text>“Nu prublems yuoor vursheep. Fur ve-a ere-a hunuoored thet yuoo ere-a oooor Greet Mester.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="33">
              <Text>And the FSM replied with very plummy Midget intonations:</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="34">
              <Text>“Midgets, while I get a huge belly laugh paying out on you with bad jokes,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="35">
              <Text>there is room for more like you in the lands of Noodle Earth.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="36">
              <Text>While you are great in many ways,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="37">
              <Text>it should be pointed out that you are not perfect.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="38">
              <Text>In fact many of you are bald.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="39">
              <Text>In that regards I have decided to create a new race of littlies called the ‘Midgits’.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="40">
              <Text>They will be improvements of great magnitude, similar the upgrade from Windows 98 to Windows 2000.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="41">
              <Text>And yes they will all have hair.”</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="42">
              <Text>And the FSM closed his googly eye stalks,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="43">
              <Text>and into the world did the Midgits pass.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="44">
              <Text>And the Midgets were both happy but jealous.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="45">
              <Text>This was mainly due to the improved hair lines of their cousins.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="46">
              <Text>And much resentment was forthcoming from the little bald dudes.Here endeth the second book.</Text>
            </Verse>
          </Verses>
        </Chapter>
        <Chapter Number="3">
          <Verses>
            <Verse Number="1">
              <Text>Following the FSM’s Great Boredom Incantation, the Midgits did pass into the lands of Noodle Earth.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="2">
              <Text>For they also did dwell upon Bobby Mountain as but guest folk of Egbert and The Midget people.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="3">
              <Text>For the Midgit hordes while declaring Bobby Mountain a most venerable place of both historic and spiritual importance</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="4">
              <Text>were really damn sick of paying rent.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="5">
              <Text>It was time for them to dwell in their own lands, grind their own pasta, and develop their own range of exotic sauces.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="6">
              <Text>The FSM like Bill Gates never fully revealed the flaws or traits engrained in his upgraded creations.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="7">
              <Text>The Midgits unlike the Midgets were blessed with great mounds of hair on both head and chest.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="8">
              <Text>For this was most advantageous for the he-midgits,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="9">
              <Text>who found picking up she-midgets a breeze, provided gold chainage and open chested lurid shirts were worn.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="10">
              <Text>The she-midgits were also given hairy chests,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="11">
              <Text>which provided the FSM with a few more thousand gags, breaking him new ground on the Celestial stand-up comedy circuit.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="12">
              <Text>The extra hair also gave the local Bobby Mountain depilatory and wig economies a real boost.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="13">
              <Text>The Midgits were great refiners of the arts and cultural activities,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="14">
              <Text>while the Midgets possessed greater farming and hunting skills.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="15">
              <Text>While Midgets were the providers of many pasta ingredients,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="16">
              <Text>the Midgits did refine and enhance the many pasta dishes of the day.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="17">
              <Text>However, the Midgets did get most peed off with the Midgits.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="18">
              <Text>For they spoke with much profanity and were culturally insensitive, speaking poor Midgetese.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="19">
              <Text>For example The Midget Greeting “Hey-a leetle freend-a’” was thus sullied by the Midgits with “Hey-a dudester”.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="20">
              <Text>And Egbert also complained to the FSM that the Midgits were favoured in the arts of being cute and cuddly, jockeying and advanced Italian cooking class.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="21">
              <Text>The Midgits too had grown tired of their fellow Midgets,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="22">
              <Text>whom they deemed simple unrefined folk,</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="23">
              <Text>content only with pleasing The Great Noodly One.</Text>
            </Verse>
            <Verse Number="24">
              <Text>The FSM thought all of this was absolutely hilarious!</Text>
            </Verse>
